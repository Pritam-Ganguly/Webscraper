##### **What is the LINQ Union Method in C#?**

The Union method in LINQ (Language Integrated Query) produces a set union of two sequences. This means it combines the elements from both sequences into a new sequence while removing duplicate elements. Itâ€™s similar to the UNION operation in SQL. The Union method is available in .NET for different types of collections like arrays, lists, etc. 

The Union method takes two sequences as input. These can be arrays, lists, or other types implementing the IEnumerable<T> interface. This method resides in the **System.Linq** namespace. As shown in the image below, two overloaded versions are available for the LINQ Union Method.

![What is LINQ Union Method?](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c-users-pranaya-pictures-linq-union-method-in-c-.png "What is LINQ Union Method?")

The one and only difference between the above two LINQ Union methods is that the second overloaded version takes **IEqualityComparer** as an argument. That means when working with Complex Data Types, we can use the overloaded method to work as expected, which takes the IEqualityComparer parameter.

##### **Key Points about LINQ Union Method:**

- **Eliminating Duplicates:** Union automatically removes duplicate elements. This differs from the Concat method, which concatenates two sequences without removing duplicates.
- **Equality Comparison:** By default, this is based on the default equality comparer for the type of elements in the sequences. For example, for integers, it uses integer equality. You can provide a custom equality comparer if necessary.
- **Deferred Execution:** The method uses deferred execution. The query is not executed until you iterate over the result.
- **Null Values:** If either of the collections is null, Union will throw an ArgumentNullException.
- **Resulting Sequence:** The result is a new sequence containing distinct elements from both input sequences.
- **Performance Considerations:** The Union method internally uses a Set<T> to keep track of elements that have already been added. This helps in efficiently determining duplicates. The performance can depend on the size of the input sequences and the complexity of the equality comparison.

##### **Examples to Understand LINQ Union Method with Value Type in C#**

Let us understand the LINQ Union Method in C# with an Example. Please have a look at the below image. As you can see in the image below, we have two integer data sources, i.e., DataSource 1 and DataSource 2. DataSource 1 contains elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and DataSource 2 contains elements 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10. If we want to retrieve all the elements from both collections by removing the duplicate element, i.e., if we want the result as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10, then we need to use the LINQ Union Method.

![Examples to Understand LINQ Union Method using C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c-users-pranaya-pictures-linq-union-method-exampl.png "Examples to Understand LINQ Union Method using C#")

##### **LINQ Union Method Example using Method and Query Syntax in C#:**

The following example shows the LINQ Union Method using both Method and Query Syntax to fetch all elements from both collections by removing the duplicate elements. In LINQ Query Syntax, no such operator called Union is available, so here, we need to use the mixed syntax, i.e., both the query and method syntax, to achieve the same.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<int> dataSource1 = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
            List<int> dataSource2 = new List<int>() { 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10 };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = dataSource1.Union(dataSource2).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from num in dataSource1
                      select num)
                      .Union(dataSource2).ToList();

            foreach (var item in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Run the application, and you will see the output as expected, i.e., 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10

##### **What happens if any Sequences are null while Performing the Union Operation in C#?**

The Union Method will throw an exception if any sequence is null. In the below example, the second sequence is null, and while performing the Union operation using the Union Method, it will throw an exception.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<int> dataSource1 = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
            List<int> dataSource2 = null;

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = dataSource1.Union(dataSource2).ToList();

            foreach (var item in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now run the application, and you will get the following exception

![What happens if any of the sequences is null while performing the Intersect Operation](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/What-happens-if-any-of-the-sequences-is-null-while-performing-the-Intersect-Operation-1.png "What happens if any of the sequences is null while performing the Intersect Operation")

##### **LINQ Union Method Example with String Array using C#** **:** 

Let us see an example to understand how the LINQ Union Method works with string collection in C#. Here, in the below example, we have two arrays of countries that also contain the same country name, and our requirement is to return all countries from both collections by removing duplicate country names.

```
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string[] dataSource1 = { "India", "USA", "UK", "Canada", "Srilanka" };
            string[] dataSource2 = { "India", "uk", "Canada", "France", "Japan" };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = dataSource1.Union(dataSource2).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from country in dataSource1
                      select country)
                      .Union(dataSource2).ToList();

            foreach (var item in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, run the application, and it will give us the following output.

![LINQ Union Method Example with String Array using C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/word-image-25.png "LINQ Union Method Example with String Array using C#")

As you can see, it displays the country **UK** twice. This is because the default comparer that is being used by the LINQ Union method is case-insensitive. So, if you want to ignore the case-sensitive, you need to use the other overloaded version of the Union method, which takes **IEqualityComparer** as an argument. Let us modify the Main method of the program class as follows to use the **StringComparer** as an argument that implements the **IEqualityComparer** interface.

```
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string[] dataSource1 = { "India", "USA", "UK", "Canada", "Srilanka" };
            string[] dataSource2 = { "India", "uk", "Canada", "France", "Japan" };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = dataSource1.Union(dataSource2, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from country in dataSource1
                      select country)
                      .Union(dataSource2, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase).ToList();

            foreach (var item in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now run the application, and it should display the data as expected, as shown in the below image.

![LINQ Union Method Example using Method and Query Syntax](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/word-image-26.png "LINQ Union Method Example using Method and Query Syntax") 

##### **LINQ Union Method with Complex Type in C#:**

The LINQ Union() Method, like other Set Methods (such as Distinct, Expect, and Intersect), also works differently when working with complex data types such as Product, Employee, Student, etc. Let us understand this with an example. Create a class file named **Student.cs** and copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
}
```

The Student class has two properties, i.e., ID and Name. Letâ€™s say we have the following two data sources containing duplicate data.

![LINQ Union Method with Complex Type in C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/c-users-pranaya-pictures-intersect-method-example-1.png "LINQ Union Method with Complex Type in C#")

As you can see in the above image, we have two student data collections. And if you notice, we have two students, Hina and Anurag, who appeared in both collections. Our requirement is to fetch all the student names from both collections by removing the duplicate names. That means we want the names Hina and Anurag to appear only once in the result. To achieve the same, we need to use the LINQ Union Method. 

So, modify the Main method of the Program class as follows. In the example below, from the first data source, we are fetching the student names by using the select method, then we use the Union method, and then we are fetching the student names from the second data source.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1.Select(x => x.Name)
                     .Union(StudentCollection2.Select(y => y.Name)).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select std.Name)
                      .Union(StudentCollection2.Select(y => y.Name)).ToList();

            foreach (var name in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(name);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

When you run the above code, you will get the output as expected, as shown in the below image. Here, you can see the names Hina and Anurag appeared only once.

![LINQ Union Method Example with Complex Type in C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/word-image-27.png "LINQ Union Method Example with Complex Type in C#")

Our requirement has changed, and we need to select all the studentsâ€™ information from both collections by removing the duplicate students. To do this, let us modify the Main Method of the Program class as shown below.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1.Union(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select std).Union(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" ID : {student.ID} Name : {student.Name}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Once you run the application, you will see that it displays all the students without removing the duplicate students, as shown in the below image. 

![LINQ Union Method Example with Complex Type](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LINQ-Union-Method-Example-with-Complex-Type.png "LINQ Union Method Example with Complex Type")

As you can see in the above output, the students Hina and Anurag appeared twice. This is because the default compare, used for comparison by the LINQ Union Method, only checked whether two object references are equal and not the individual property values of the complex object. As discussed in our previous three articles, we can overcome this problem in many ways. Let us understand each way one by one.

##### **Using IEqualityComparer Comparer with LINQ Union Method in C#:**

In this approach, we need to create a class and then implement the **IEqualityComparer** interface and provide the implementation for the Equals and GetHashCode methods. So, create a class file named **StudentComparer.cs** and copy and paste the following code.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class StudentComparer : IEqualityComparer<Student>
    {
        public bool Equals(Student x, Student y)
        {
            return x.ID == y.ID && x.Name == y.Name;
        }

        public int GetHashCode(Student obj)
        {
            return obj.ID.GetHashCode() ^ obj.Name.GetHashCode();
        }
    }
}
```

Next, we need to create an instance of the **StudentComparer** class, and then we need to pass that instance to the Union method, which takes **IEqualityComparer** as a parameter. So, modify the Main method of the Program class as follows.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            StudentComparer studentComparer = new StudentComparer();

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1
                     .Union(StudentCollection2, studentComparer).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select std)
                      .Union(StudentCollection2, studentComparer).ToList();

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" ID : {student.ID} Name : {student.Name}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

With the above changes in place, run the application, and you will get the output as expected, as shown in the below image. Here, you can see Hina and Anurag appeared only once.

**![Using IEqualityComparer Comparer with LINQ Union Method in C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/word-image-29911-7.png "Using IEqualityComparer Comparer with LINQ Union Method in C#")**

##### **Using Anonymous Type with Union Method in C#:**

In this approach, we must select all the individual properties to an anonymous type using the LINQ select operator or Select Extension Method. The following program does exactly the same thing.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1.Select(x => new { x.ID, x.Name })
                     .Union(StudentCollection2.Select(x => new { x.ID, x.Name })).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select new { std.ID, std.Name })
                      .Union(StudentCollection2.Select(x => new { x.ID, x.Name })).ToList();

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" ID : {student.ID} Name : {student.Name}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

With the above changes in place, run the application, and you will get the output as expected, as shown in the image below.

**![Using Anonymous Type with Union Method in C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/word-image-29911-8.png "Using Anonymous Type with Union Method in C#")**

##### **Overriding Equals() and GetHashCode() Methods of Object Class**

This is the third approach, and in this approach, we need to override the Equals and GetHashCode() in the Student class. By default, any type (predefined or user-defined) in .NET Framework is inherited from the Object class. That means the Student class is also inherited from the Object class. So, we can override the Equals() and GetHashCode() methods of the Object class within the Student class. So, modify the Student class as shown below. We are overriding the Equals() and GetHashCode() methods here.

```
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            //As the obj parameter type is object, so we need to
            //cast it to Student Type
            return this.ID == ((Student)obj).ID && this.Name == ((Student)obj).Name;
        }

        public override int GetHashCode()
        {
            //Get the ID hash code value
            int IDHashCode = this.ID.GetHashCode();
            //Get the string HashCode Value
            //Check for null refernece exception
            int NameHashCode = this.Name == null ? 0 : this.Name.GetHashCode();
            return IDHashCode ^ NameHashCode;
        }
    }
}
```

Next, we need to modify the Main method of the Program class, as shown below. Here, we need to use the overloaded version of the Union method, which does not take any parameter.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1.Union(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select std).Union(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" ID : {student.ID} Name : {student.Name}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now run the application code, and you will get the same output as the previous two examples as expected, as shown in the below image.

**![Overriding Equals() and GetHashCode() Methods of Object Class](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/word-image-29911-9.png "Overriding Equals() and GetHashCode() Methods of Object Class")**

##### **Implementing IEquatble<T> Interface in C#**

In this approach, we need to implement the IEquatble<T> Interface in Student Class, and we need to implement the Equals Method of the IEquatble<T> Interface. We also need to override the GetHashCode method of the Object class. So, modify the Student class as shown below.

```
using System;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class Student : IEquatable<Student>
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public bool Equals(Student other)
        {
            return this.ID.Equals(other.ID) && this.Name.Equals(other.Name);
        }
        public override int GetHashCode()
        {
            int IDHashCode = this.ID.GetHashCode();
            int NameHashCode = this.Name == null ? 0 : this.Name.GetHashCode();
            return IDHashCode ^ NameHashCode;
        }
    }
}
```

Here, first, we implement the Equals method of the IEquatable interface, and then we override the GetHashCode method of the Object class. With the above changes in place, now modify the Main Method of the Program class as shown below.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1.Union(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select std).Union(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" ID : {student.ID} Name : {student.Name}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, run the application, and you will also get the same output as expected, as shown in the below image.

##### **When should we use the LINQ Union Method in C#?**

The LINQ Union method in .NET combines two collections into one while removing duplicate elements. It is useful in scenarios where you need distinct elements from multiple sources. Here are some typical situations where the Union method might be the right choice:

- **Combining Distinct Elements from Two Collections:** When you have two lists, arrays, or other enumerable collections and you want to create a new collection that contains elements from both, without any duplicates, Union is ideal. This is common in scenarios like merging two lists of tags, keywords, or categories.
- **Creating a Distinct Set from Multiple Sources:** If you are aggregating data from different sources and want to ensure that the resulting collection has no duplicates, Union can be very helpful. For example, you might merge user data from different databases or combine product lists from multiple stores.
- **Data Analysis and Reporting:** In scenarios where you need to perform analysis or generate reports that require a unified view of distinct elements from multiple datasets, Union can simplify the process. This might involve combining customer lists from different regions or merging survey results from various groups.
- **Simplifying Queries:** When using LINQ to Entities or LINQ to SQL, Union can help you construct more concise and readable queries that combine data from multiple sources while ensuring that the results are distinct.
- **Set Operations:** Union is a set operation, which means itâ€™s useful in scenarios where you are dealing with sets of data and need to perform operations akin to the mathematical set union.
- **Handling Collections of Complex Types:** Like with Intersect, when working with collections of custom or complex types, you might need to implement IEquatable<T> or provide an IEqualityComparer<T> to ensure the Union operation correctly identifies and removes duplicates based on specific properties or criteria.

In the next article, I will discuss the **[LINQ Concat Method using C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/linq-concat-operator/)** with Examples. In this article, I explain the LINQ Union Method using C# with Examples. I hope you enjoy this article and understand the concept of the LINQ Union Method in C# with Examples.
