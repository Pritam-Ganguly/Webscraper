## **LINQ OrderBy Method in C# with Examples**

In this article, I will discuss the **LINQ OrderBy Method in C#** with Examples. Please read our previous article discussing the basics of **[LINQ Ordering Operators](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/ordering-operators-in-linq/)**. As part of this article, we are going to discuss the following pointers, which are related to the LINQ OrderBy method.

1. **What is the LINQ OrderBy Method?**
2. **Example of LINQ OrderBy Method using both Method and Query Syntax.**
3. **How do you use the LINQ OrderBy Method with Complex Type in C#?**
4. **How do you use the OrderBy method along with the Filtering method?**
5. **How do you create and use your own Comparer with the LINQ OrderBy Method in C#?**
6. **When to Use the LINQ OrderBy Method?**

##### **What is the Linq OrderBy Method?**

The LINQ OrderBy Method is used to sort elements in a collection based on the specified key(s) used in C# and other .NET languages. The OrderBy method is used to sort the elements of a collection in ascending order based on a specified key. The OrderBy method is part of the System.Linq namespace and can be used with any collection that implements the IEnumerable<T> interface, such as arrays, lists, or any other enumerable types.

This method is not going to change the data. Rather, it is just going to change the order of the data. You can use the OrderBy method on any data type, i.e., you can use character, string, decimal, integer, etc. There are two overloaded versions of this OrderBy Method available inside LINQ. They are as follows.

![Linq OrderBy Method in C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Linq-OrderBy-Method-in-C.png?ezimgfmt=rs%3Adevice%2Frscb8-1 "Linq OrderBy Method in C#")

Here, TSource is the data source, and TKey is the property of the data source’s items that you want to sort by. The only difference between these two overloaded versions is that the second version takes the IComparer parameter, which compares the keys when creating our custom comparer. Let us understand using the above two LINQ OrderBy methods in C# using Query Syntax and Method Syntax.

##### **LINQ OrderBy Method with Value Data Type in C#**

Let us see an example of how the LINQ OrderBy Method works with Value Data Type in C#. In the below example, we have a collection of integer data. Then, we sort the data in ascending order using the LINQ OrderBy method using both Method and Query Syntax using C# language.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<int> intList = new List<int>() { 10, 45, 35, 29, 100, 69, 58, 50 };

            Console.WriteLine("Before Sorting : ");
            foreach (var item in intList)
            {
                Console.Write(item + " ");
            }

            //Sorting the data in Ascending Order
            //Using Method Syntax
            var MS = intList.OrderBy(num => num);

            //Using Query Syntax
            var QS = (from num in intList
                      orderby num
                      select num).ToList();

            Console.WriteLine();
            Console.WriteLine("After Sorting : ");
            foreach (var item in QS)
            {
                Console.Write(item + " ");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, run the application, and you will get the following output.

![LINQ OrderBy Method with Value Data Type in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22261%22%20height=%2291%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "LINQ OrderBy Method with Value Data Type in C#")

##### **OrderBy Method Key Characteristics:**

- By default, sorting is case-sensitive and in ascending order. To sort in descending order, you can use the OrderByDescending method.
- One important aspect of LINQ is deferred execution. When you call OrderBy, it doesn’t immediately sort the data. Instead, it returns an IOrderedEnumerable<T> containing the sorting logic. The actual sorting happens when you iterate over this enumerable, for example, by using a for each loop or converting it to a list.

##### **LINQ OrderBy Method with String Data Type in C#**

Let us see an example of how the LINQ OrderBy Method works with String Data Type using C#. In the below example, we have a collection of string names. We then sort the data in ascending order using the LINQ OrderBy method with both Method and Query syntax.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<string> stringList = new List<string>() { "Preety", "Tiwary", "Agrawal", "Priyanka", "Dewangan",
            "Hina","Kumar","Manoj", "Rout", "James"};

            //Using Method Syntax
            var MS = stringList.OrderBy(name => name);

            //Using Query Syntax
            var QS = (from name in stringList
                       orderby name ascending
                       select name).ToList();

            foreach (var item in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item + " ");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

When you run the above code, you will get the following output.

![LINQ OrderBy Method with String Data Type in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22150%22%20height=%22247%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "LINQ OrderBy Method with String Data Type in C#")

**Note:** In the Query Syntax, the ascending operator is optional while sorting the data in ascending order. That means if we are not specifying anything, then by default, it is ascending. So, the following two statements are the same.

![OrderBy Method in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22573%22%20height=%22276%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "OrderBy Method in C#")

##### **LINQ OrderBy Method with Complex Data Type in C#:**

Let us see how the LINQ OrderBy Method works with Complex Data Types in C# with some Examples. We are going to work with the following Student class. So, create a class file named **Student.cs** and copy and paste the following code. As you can see, we created the Student class with four properties: **ID, FirstName, LastName,** and **Brach**. We then created one method, i.e., **GetAllStudents(),** to return a list of students.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        public string Branch { get; set; }

        public static List<Student> GetAllStudents()
        {
            List<Student> listStudents = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student{ID= 101,FirstName = "Preety",LastName = "Tiwary",Branch = "CSE"},
                new Student{ID= 102,FirstName = "Preety",LastName = "Agrawal",Branch = "ETC"},
                new Student{ID= 103,FirstName = "Priyanka",LastName = "Dewangan",Branch = "ETC"},
                new Student{ID= 104,FirstName = "Hina",LastName = "Sharma",Branch = "ETC"},
                new Student{ID= 105,FirstName = "Anugrag",LastName = "Mohanty",Branch = "CSE"},
                new Student{ID= 106,FirstName = "Anurag",LastName = "Sharma",Branch = "CSE"},
                new Student{ID= 107,FirstName = "Pranaya",LastName = "Kumar",Branch = "CSE"},
                new Student{ID= 108,FirstName = "Manoj",LastName = "Kumar",Branch = "ETC"},
                new Student{ID= 109,FirstName = "Pranaya",LastName = "Rout",Branch = "ETC"},
                new Student{ID= 110,FirstName = "Saurav",LastName = "Rout",Branch = "CSE"}
            };

            return listStudents;
        }
    }
}
```

Now, we want to sort the student data based on the Branch of the Student in ascending order. To do so, modify the Main method of the Program class as follows. In the example below, we are sorting the data in ascending order based on the student branch using the LINQ OrderBy Method with both Method and Query Syntax.

```
using System.Linq;
using System;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Method Syntax
            var MS = Student.GetAllStudents().OrderBy(x => x.Branch).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in Student.GetAllStudents()
                      orderby std.Branch
                      select std);

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(" Branch: " + student.Branch + ", Name :" + student.FirstName + " " + student.LastName );
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

When you run the above code, you will get the following output.

![LINQ OrderBy Method with Complex Data Type in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22358%22%20height=%22213%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "LINQ OrderBy Method with Complex Data Type in C#")

##### **Sorting with Filtering using LINQ**

Now we need to fetch only the CSE branch students, and then we need to sort the data based on the First Name in Ascending order. The most important point you need to remember is to use the Where method before the OrderBy method. This is because it will filter and sort the filtered results, improving the application’s performance. The following example uses LINQ OrderBy and Where Method with Query and Method Syntax.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Method Syntax
            var MS = Student.GetAllStudents()
                            .Where(std => std.Branch.ToUpper() == "CSE")
                            .OrderBy(x => x.FirstName).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in Student.GetAllStudents()
                      where std.Branch.ToUpper() == "CSE"
                      orderby std.FirstName
                      select std);

            foreach (var student in QS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(" Branch: " + student.Branch + ", Name :" + student.FirstName + " " + student.LastName );
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

When you run the above code, you will get the following output as expected.

![Sorting with Filtering using LINQ](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22335%22%20height=%22114%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Sorting with Filtering using LINQ")

##### **How do you create and use your own Comparer with the LINQ OrderBy Method in C#?**

Creating and using our Comparer with the LINQ OrderBy Method is also possible. We need to use the Second Overloaded version of the OrderBy Method, which takes the IComparer parameter. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class CaseInsensitiveComparer : IComparer<string>
    {
        public int Compare(string x, string y)
        {
            return string.Compare(x, y, true);
        }
    }

    public class MainClass
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            CaseInsensitiveComparer caseInsensitiveComparer = new CaseInsensitiveComparer();
            string[] Alphabets = { "a", "b", "c", "A", "B", "C"};
            var SortedAlphabets = Alphabets.OrderBy(aplhabet => aplhabet, caseInsensitiveComparer);
            foreach (var item in SortedAlphabets)
            {
                Console.Write(item + " ");
            }
            Console.Read();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output: a A b B c C**

##### **When should you use the LINQ OrderBy Method in C#?**

Here are some common use cases for employing the OrderBy method:

- **Sorting Simple Collections:** When you have a simple collection like a list of integers, strings, or dates, and you want to sort them in ascending order.
- **Sorting Complex Objects:** When dealing with collections of complex objects, you can use OrderBy to sort by a specific property of the objects. For example, if you have a list of Employee objects, you might want to sort them by their LastName property.
- **Preparing Data for Display:** Often, in user interfaces, you need to display data in a sorted manner. OrderBy can be used to sort the data before binding it to a control like a grid or a list.
- **Sorting before Performing Other Operations:** Sometimes, other operations like GroupBy or even another OrderBy (for secondary sorting) work better or are easier to understand when applied to a sorted list.
- **Readability and Maintainability:** Using OrderBy makes your intention clear to whoever is reading the code that the collection is meant to be processed in a sorted order. This improves code readability and maintainability.
- **LINQ Queries:** In LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework queries, using OrderBy can translate to SQL ORDER BY clauses, sorting the data at the database level, which is often more efficient.
- **Chain of LINQ Operations:** OrderBy can be used in a chain of LINQ operations to ensure that the sorting is done as a part of a more complex querying process.
- **Data Analysis:** In data processing or analysis tasks, sorting data can be an initial step to organize it for pattern detection, statistical analysis, or simplifying complex operations.
- **Improving Query Efficiency:** In certain cases, sorting data can make subsequent queries more efficient, especially when combined with operations like First or FirstOrDefault, where you might be interested in the top item according to some criteria
- **Custom Sorting Logic:** OrderBy can be used with a custom comparer or a lambda expression, offering flexibility to define complex sorting logic beyond simple property-based sorting.

In the next article, I will discuss sorting the data in descending order using the [**LINQ OrderByDescending Method in C#**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/linq-orderbydescending-method/) with Examples. In this article, I explain the need and use of the LINQ OrderBy Method in C# with Examples. I hope you enjoy this OrderBy Method in C# article.
