# LINQ ToList and ToArray Methods in C#

Back to: [LINQ Tutorial For Beginners and Professionals](https://dotnettutorials.net/course/linq/)

## **LINQ ToList and ToArray Methods in C# with Examples**

In this article, I will discuss the **LINQ ToList and ToArray Methods** **in C#** with Examples. Please read our previous article discussing the [**LINQ Zip Method in C#**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/linq-zip-method/) with Examples. The LINQ ToList and ToArray Methods in C# belong to the conversion operator category.

The LINQ ToList and ToArray methods in C# are used to convert collections or sequences to a List<T> or an array T[], respectively. Both methods are part of the System.Linq namespace can be applied to any type implementing IEnumerable<T>. These methods are commonly used for materializing query results into concrete collections.

##### **LINQ ToList Method in C#:**

The LINQ ToList Method in C# creates a List<T> from an IEnumerable<T>. This is particularly useful when you need a list with the functionality it provides, like the ability to add or remove items. This method create a System.Collections.Generic.List<T> collection from a System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>. This method causes the query to be executed immediately. The signature of the ToList method is shown below.

![ToList and ToArray Methods in Linq with Examples](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22805%22%20height=%2266%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "ToList and ToArray Methods in Linq with Examples")

###### **Parameters:**

- **source:** The data type of source is **System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>**.

###### **Type parameters:**

- **TSource:** The type of elements contained in the source sequence.

###### **Returns:**

- It returns **System.Collections.Generic.List<T>,** which contains elements from the source sequence.

###### **Exceptions:**

- This method throws **System.ArgumentNullException** when the source sequence is null.

##### **Example to Convert int array to List<int> using the LINQ ToList Method in C#**

In the following example, we first create an integer array and then convert that integer array into a list (i.e., List<int>) by using the LINQ ToList Method in C#. 

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System;
namespace LINQToListMethodDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            //Creating Integer Array
            int[] numbersArray = { 10, 22, 30, 40, 50, 60 };

            //Converting Integer Array to List using ToList method
            List<int> numbersList = numbersArray.ToList();

            //Accessing the List Elements
            foreach (var num in numbersList)
            {
                Console.Write($"{num} ");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output: 10 22 30 40 50 60**

##### **Working with Complex Type:**

Let us see how we can work with the ToArray method of a collection of Complex Types. For this, we are going to use the following Employee class. So, create a class file named **Employee.cs** and copy and paste the following code. Itâ€™s a very simple class, having only three properties.

```
namespace LINQToArrayMethodDemo
{
    public class Employee
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Department { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Next, modify the Main method of the Program class as follows. As you can see, first, we are creating an array of Employees and storing 5 employee information. Then, we convert that array of Employees to a list of Employees by calling the ToList Method.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System;
namespace LINQToArrayMethodDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            //Create an Array of Employees
            Employee[] EmployeesArray = new Employee[]
            {
                new Employee() {ID = 1, Name = "Pranaya", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 2, Name = "Priyanka", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 3, Name = "Preety", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 4, Name = "Sambit", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 5, Name = "Sudhanshu", Department = "IT"}
            };

            //Converting Array to List
            List<Employee> EmployeesList = EmployeesArray.ToList();

            //Accessing the Elements of the List
            foreach (var emp in EmployeesArray)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"ID: {emp.ID}, Name: {emp.Name}, Department: {emp.Department}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

###### **Output:**

![Working with Complex Type](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22472%22%20height=%22122%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Working with Complex Type")

##### **What happens when the Source Array is Null?**

When the Source Array is Null, and if we try to convert that null array into a list using the ToList method, we will get one runtime exception saying the value cannot be null. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following example. In the example below, we create one null array and then convert that integer null array to a list.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System;
namespace LINQToListMethodDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            //Creating Integer Array and Initializing it with NULL
            int[] numbersArray = null;

            //Converting Integer Array to List using ToList method
            List<int> numbersList = numbersArray.ToList();

            //Accessing the List Elements
            foreach (var num in numbersList)
            {
                Console.Write($"{num} ");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

You will get the following exception at runtime when you run the above code.

![LINQ ToList and ToArray Methods in C# with Examples](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22746%22%20height=%22285%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "LINQ ToList and ToArray Methods in C# with Examples")

##### **LINQ ToArray Method in C#:**

The LINQ ToArray Method converts an IEnumerable<T> to an array T[]. This is useful when you need a fixed-size collection or interfacing with APIs requiring arrays. This method copy the elements of the System.Collections.Generic.List<T> to a new array. This method causes the query to be executed immediately. The signature of this method is shown below.

![Linq ToArray Method](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22221%22%20height=%2255%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)

Here, T is the array type, and this method converts a list into an array and returns that array containing copies of the elements of the System.Collections.Generic.List<T>.

##### **Example: Convert List<int> to Integer Array in C# using LINQ ToArray Method.** 

In the following example, first, we create a list of integers and then convert that list of integers into an integer array (i.e., int[]) by using the LINQ ToArray Method in C#. The following code is self-explained, so please go through the comment lines for a better understanding.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
namespace LINQToArrayMethodDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            //Create a List
            List<int> numbersList = new List<int>()
            {
                10, 22, 30, 40, 50, 60
            };

            //Converting List to Array
            int[] numbersArray = numbersList.ToArray();

            //Accessing the Elements of the Array
            foreach (var num in numbersArray)
            {
                Console.Write($"{num} ");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

**Output: 10 22 30 40 50 60**

##### **Working with Complex Type:**

We are going to work with the same Employee class. So, modify the Main method of the Program class as follows. As you can see, first, we are creating a list collection of type Employees and storing 5 employee information. Then, we convert that list of Employees to an array of Employees by calling the ToArray Method.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
namespace LINQToArrayMethodDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            //Create a List of Employees
            List<Employee> EmployeesList = new List<Employee>()
            {
                new Employee() {ID = 1, Name = "Pranaya", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 2, Name = "Priyanka", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 3, Name = "Preety", Department = "HR" },
                new Employee() {ID = 4, Name = "Sambit", Department = "IT" },
                new Employee() {ID = 5, Name = "Sudhanshu", Department = "IT"}
            };

            //Converting List to Array
            Employee[] EmployeesArray = EmployeesList.ToArray();

            //Accessing the Elements of the Array
            foreach (var emp in EmployeesArray)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"ID: {emp.ID}, Name: {emp.Name}, Department: {emp.Department}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

###### **Output:**

![Working with Complex Type](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22472%22%20height=%22122%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Working with Complex Type")

##### **What Happens When We Call the ToArray Method on a Null List?**

We will get a Null Reference Exception if we call the ToArray Method on a Null List. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following example. In the below example, we are creating one list, initializing that list with NULL, and then calling the ToArrya method on that list instance.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
namespace LINQToArrayMethodDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            //Create a List
            List<int> numbersList = null;

            //Converting List to Array
            int[] numbersArray = numbersList.ToArray();

            //Accessing the Elements of the Array
            foreach (var num in numbersArray)
            {
                Console.Write($"{num} ");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

When you run the above code, you will get the following Exception.

![What Happens when we call the ToArray Method on a List which is Null](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22720%22%20height=%22276%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "What Happens when we call the ToArray Method on a List which is Null")

##### **Key Points**

- **Materialization:** ToList and ToArray are used for materializing the results of a LINQ query. This means they execute the query and create a concrete collection with the results.
- **Immutability of Results:** The resulting List<T> or T[] is a snapshot of the data during the call. Subsequent changes to the source collection do not affect the listâ€™s contents or array.
- **Memory Allocation:** Both methods allocate memory for the new collection. This can be a consideration for very large datasets.
- **Choice of Method:** Use ToList when you need the dynamic features of a list (like adding or removing items), and use ToArray when you need a fixed-size, immutable collection or are interfacing with APIs that require arrays.

Both ToList and ToArray are commonly used in scenarios where you need to work with the results of a LINQ query as a standard collection, like in data-binding scenarios or when passing data to methods that require specific collection types.
