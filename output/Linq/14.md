## **LINQ Intersect Method in C# with Examples**

In this article, I will discuss the **LINQ Intersect Method using C#** with Examples. Please read our previous article discussing the **[LINQ Except Method in C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/linq-except-method/)** with Examples. The LINQ Intersect Method in C# is used to find the set intersection of two sequences. As part of this article, I will discuss the following pointers.

##### **What is the LINQ Intersect Method?**

The Intersect method in LINQ finds common elements between two sequences (collections). This method is available in .NET for different types of collections, such as lists, arrays, etc. It’s useful when you need to compare two sets of data and find the elements that are present in both sets.

The Intersect method is part of the **System.Linq** namespace can be applied to any type implementing IEnumerable<T>. There are two overloaded versions available for the Intersect Method in C#. They are as follows.

![LINQ Intersect Method in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22849%22%20height=%22179%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "LINQ Intersect Method in C#")

The only difference between the two LINQ Intersect methods is that the second overloaded version uses **IEqualityComparer** as an argument. That means when working with Complex Types, we can use the overloaded method to work as expected, which takes the IEqualityComparer parameter.

##### **Key Features of LINQ Intersect Method:**

- **Input Sequences:** The Intersect method takes two sequences as input. These sequences can be arrays, lists, or any other collection type that implements IEnumerable<T>.
- **Comparison:** It compares the elements of both sequences to find common elements. By default, this comparison is based on the default equality comparer for the type of elements in the sequences. For example, if the elements are integers, it uses the integer equality comparison.
- **Distinct Elements:** The method returns a new sequence containing the distinct elements that appear in both input sequences. Even if an element appears multiple times in both sequences, it will appear only once in the result.
- **Deferred Execution:** The Intersect uses deferred execution. The actual intersection computation is delayed until you iterate over the query.

##### **Examples to Understand LINQ Intersect Method with Value Type**

Let us understand the LINQ Intersect Method with an example. Please have a look at the below image. As you can see in the image below, we have two integer data sources, i.e., DataSource 1 and Data Source 2. DataSource 1 contains elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and DataSource 2 contains elements 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10. If we want to retrieve the elements, such as 1, 3, and 5, which exist in both data sources, then we need to use the LINQ Intersect method.

![Examples to Understand LINQ Intersect Method using C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22383%22%20height=%22224%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Examples to Understand LINQ Intersect Method using C#")

##### **LINQ Intersect() Method Example using Method and Query Syntax:**

The following example shows the use of the LINQ Intersect() Method using both Method and Query Syntax to fetch the common elements that exist in both collections. There is no such operator called Intersect in query syntax, so we need to use mixed syntax, i.e., both the query and method syntax, to achieve the same.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<int> dataSource1 = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
            List<int> dataSource2 = new List<int>() { 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10 };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = dataSource1.Intersect(dataSource2).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from num in dataSource1
                      select num)
                      .Intersect(dataSource2).ToList();

            foreach (var item in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Run the application, and you will see the output as 1 3 5.

##### **What happens if any sequences are null while performing the Intersect Operation?**

The Intersect Method will throw an exception if any sequences are null. In the example below, the second sequence is null, and performing the Intersect operation using the Intersect Method will throw an exception.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<int> dataSource1 = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
            List<int> dataSource2 = null;

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = dataSource1.Intersect(dataSource2).ToList();
            
            foreach (var item in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now run the application, and you will get the following exception.

![What happens if any of the sequences is null while performing the Intersect Operation](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22820%22%20height=%22397%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "What happens if any of the sequences is null while performing the Intersect Operation")

##### **LINQ Intersect() Method Example with String Array using C#****:** 

Let us see the examples to understand how the Intersect Method works with string collection. In the example below, we have two arrays of countries, and our requirement is to return the common countries, i.e., the countries that exist in both collections.

```
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string[] dataSource1 = { "India", "USA", "UK", "Canada", "Srilanka" };
            string[] dataSource2 = { "India", "uk", "Canada", "France", "Japan" };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = dataSource1.Intersect(dataSource2).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from country in dataSource1
                      select country)
                      .Intersect(dataSource2).ToList();

            foreach (var item in QS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now run the application, and you will get the following output.

![LINQ Intersect() Method Example with String Array using C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%2277%22%20height=%2248%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "LINQ Intersect() Method Example with String Array using C#")

As you can see, it displays only India and Canada. If you look at our collections, you can see the country “UK” is present in both collections, but the Intersect method did not fetch that country. This is because the default comparer that is being used by the Intersect method is case-insensitive.

So, if you want to ignore the case-sensitive, you need to use the other overloaded version of the Intersect() method, which takes IEqualityComparer as an argument. So, modify the program as shown below, where we pass StringComparer as an argument to the Intersect() method, which will ignore the case sensitivity while comparing the values.

```
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string[] dataSource1 = { "India", "USA", "UK", "Canada", "Srilanka" };
            string[] dataSource2 = { "India", "uk", "Canada", "France", "Japan" };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = dataSource1.Intersect(dataSource2, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from country in dataSource1
                      select country)
                      .Intersect(dataSource2, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase).ToList();

            foreach (var item in QS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(item);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now run the application, and it will display the data as expected, as shown in the below image.

![LINQ Intersect Method in C# with Examples](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%2273%22%20height=%2268%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "LINQ Intersect Method in C# with Examples") 

##### **LINQ Intersect Method with Complex Type in C#:**

The LINQ Intersect() Method, like other Set Methods (such as Distinct and Expect), also works differently when working with complex data types such as Product, Employee, Student, etc. Let us understand this with an example. Create a class file named **Student.cs** and copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
}
```

This is a very simple student class with just two properties. Let’s say we have the following two data sources.

![LINQ Intersect Method with Complex Type in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22760%22%20height=%22474%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "LINQ Intersect Method with Complex Type in C#")

As you can see in the above image, we have two student data collections. And if you notice, we have two students who appear in both collections. Our requirement is to fetch all the student names which are present in both collections. That is the common student names from both collections. To achieve this, modify the Main method of the Program class as follows. In the example below, from the first data source, we are fetching the student names by using the select method, then we use the Intersect method, and then we are fetching the student names from the second data source.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},             
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };
            
            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1.Select(x => x.Name)
                     . Intersect(StudentCollection2.Select(y => y.Name)).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select std.Name)
                      . Intersect(StudentCollection2.Select(y => y.Name)).ToList();

            foreach (var name in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(name);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

When you run the above code, you will get the output as expected, as shown in the below image:

![Example to Understand LINQ Intersect Method with Complex Type in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%2274%22%20height=%2247%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Example to Understand LINQ Intersect Method with Complex Type in C#")

##### **More Complex Examples to Understand LINQ Intersect Example:**

Now, our requirement is to select all the students’ information in both collections. To do this, let us modify the program class as shown below.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},             
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1.Intersect(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select std).Intersect(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" ID : {student.ID} Name : {student.Name}");
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Once you run the application, then it will not display any data. This is because the default comparer, used by the LINQ Intersect Method for comparison, only checks whether two object references are equal and not the individual property values of the complex object. Each student object has a different reference in this case, so it does not return any student data. As we already discussed, we can overcome this problem in many ways. Let us understand each way one by one.

##### **Using IEqualityComparer Comparer with LINQ Intersect Method in C#:**

In this approach, we need to create a class, and then we need to implement the **IEqualityComparer** interface. We need to provide the implementation for the Equals and GetHashCode methods. So, create a class file named **StudentComparer.cs** and copy and paste the following code.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class StudentComparer : IEqualityComparer<Student>
    {
        public bool Equals(Student x, Student y)
        {
            return x.ID == y.ID && x.Name == y.Name;
        }

        public int GetHashCode(Student obj)
        {
            return obj.ID.GetHashCode() ^ obj.Name.GetHashCode();
        }
    }
}
```

Next, we need to create an instance of the **StudentComparer** class, and then we need to pass that instance to the Intersect method. So, modify the Main method of the Program class as follows.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},             
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            StudentComparer studentComparer = new StudentComparer();

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1
                     .Intersect(StudentCollection2, studentComparer).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select std)
                      .Intersect(StudentCollection2, studentComparer).ToList();

            foreach (var student in QS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" ID : {student.ID} Name : {student.Name}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

With the above changes in place, run the application, and you will get the output as expected, as shown in the below image.

![Using IEqualityComparer Comparer in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22281%22%20height=%2258%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Using IEqualityComparer Comparer in C#")

##### **Using Anonymous Type with Intersect Method in C#:**

In this approach, we must select all the individual properties to an anonymous type using the LINQ select operator or Select Extension Method. The following program does exactly the same thing.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},             
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1.Select(x => new { x.ID, x.Name })
                     .Intersect(StudentCollection2.Select(x => new { x.ID, x.Name })).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select new {std.ID, std.Name })
                      .Intersect(StudentCollection2.Select(x => new { x.ID, x.Name })).ToList();

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" ID : {student.ID} Name : {student.Name}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

With the above changes in place, run the application code again, and you will get the output as expected, as shown in the below image.

![Using Anonymous Type in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22233%22%20height=%2252%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Using Anonymous Type in C#")

##### **Overriding Equals() and GetHashCode() Methods within the Student Class**

This is the third approach, and in this approach, we need to override the Equals and GetHashCode() in the Student class. By default, any type (predefined or user-defined) in .NET Framework is inherited from the Object class. That means the Student class is also inherited from the Object class. So, we can override the Equals() and GetHashCode() methods of the Object class within the Student class. So, modify the Student class as shown below. We are overriding the Equals() and GetHashCode() methods here.

```
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            //As the obj parameter type is object, so we need to
            //cast it to Student Type
            return this.ID == ((Student)obj).ID && this.Name == ((Student)obj).Name;
        }

        public override int GetHashCode()
        {
            //Get the ID hash code value
            int IDHashCode = this.ID.GetHashCode();
            //Get the string HashCode Value
            //Check for null refernece exception
            int NameHashCode = this.Name == null ? 0 : this.Name.GetHashCode();
            return IDHashCode ^ NameHashCode;
        }
    }
}
```

Next, we need to modify the Main method of the Program class, as shown below. Here, we need to use the overloaded version of the Intersect method, which does not take any parameter.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1.Intersect(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select std).Intersect(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" ID : {student.ID} Name : {student.Name}");
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now run the application, and again, you will get the same output as the previous two examples, as shown in the below image.

##### **Implementing IEquatble<T> Interface in Student Class**

This is the last approach, and, in this approach, we need to implement the IEquatble<T> Interface in the Student Class. We need to implement the Equals Method of the IEquatble<T> Interface, and we also need to override the GetHashCode method of the Object class. So, modify the Student class as shown below.

```
using System;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class Student : IEquatable<Student>
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }

        public bool Equals(Student other)
        {
            return this.ID.Equals(other.ID) && this.Name.Equals(other.Name);
        }
        public override int GetHashCode()
        {
            int IDHashCode = this.ID.GetHashCode();
            int NameHashCode = this.Name == null ? 0 : this.Name.GetHashCode();
            return IDHashCode ^ NameHashCode;
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, we have done two things here. First, we implement the Equals method of the IEquatable interface, and then we override the GetHashCode method of the Object class. With the above changes in place, now modify the Main Method of the Program class as shown below.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<Student> StudentCollection1 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 101, Name = "Preety" },
                new Student {ID = 102, Name = "Sambit" },
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
            };

            List<Student> StudentCollection2 = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student {ID = 105, Name = "Hina"},
                new Student {ID = 106, Name = "Anurag"},
                new Student {ID = 107, Name = "Pranaya"},
                new Student {ID = 108, Name = "Santosh"},
            };

            //Method Syntax
            var MS = StudentCollection1.Intersect(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            //Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in StudentCollection1
                      select std).Intersect(StudentCollection2).ToList();

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($" ID : {student.ID} Name : {student.Name}");
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, run the application, and you will also get the same output as expected, as shown in the below image.

![Implementing IEquatble<T> Interface](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22233%22%20height=%2252%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Implementing IEquatble<T> Interface")

##### **When should you use the LINQ Intersect Method in C#?**

The LINQ (Language Integrated Query) Intersect method in .NET is useful in various scenarios, particularly when finding common elements between two collections. Here are some typical situations where Intersect might be the right choice:

- **Finding Common Items in Collections:** If you have two lists, arrays, or other enumerable collections and you need to find the elements that appear in both collections, Intersect is the ideal method. This is useful in comparing datasets, such as finding shared interests between two users or shared items in inventory lists.
- **Data Filtering Based on Another Collection:** Sometimes, you might want to filter one collection based on the elements of another collection. For instance, if you have a list of product IDs that a customer is interested in and a list of product IDs available in a store, using Intersect can help you find the products that are both interesting to the customer and available in the store.
- **Distinct Common Elements:** Intersect automatically removes duplicates from the result set. This is beneficial when you only need to know which elements are common without caring about how many times they appear in each collection.
- **Set Operations in Database Queries:** When working with databases, Intersect can be used in LINQ to Entities or LINQ to SQL queries to perform set-based operations. This is useful in scenarios where you need to perform complex queries that involve finding common elements between different tables or datasets.
- **Comparing Object Collections:** Intersect can also be used to compare collections of objects. By implementing custom equality comparers, you can use Intersect to find common objects between two collections based on specific criteria or properties.
- **Efficiency in Large Datasets:** In cases where you are dealing with large datasets, Intersect can be more efficient than manual looping and comparison, as it’s optimized for set operations.
