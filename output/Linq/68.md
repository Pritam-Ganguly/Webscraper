#### **Quick Recap of LINQ**

LINQ, which stands for Language Integrated Query, is a powerful feature of .NET languages like C# that allows you to write concise, declarative code for operating on data. The beauty of LINQ is that it provides a unified approach to querying data from different sources, whether in-memory collections, databases, XML documents, or even remote data via web services. Here’s a quick recap of its key features and usage:

##### **Key Features of LINQ:**

- **Unified Syntax:** LINQ offers a consistent querying experience across various data sources.
- **IntelliSense Support:** Because LINQ is tightly integrated with .NET, you get full IntelliSense support in IDEs like Visual Studio, making writing and debugging queries easier.
- **Strongly Typed:** LINQ queries are strongly typed, so you get compile-time checking of your queries, leading to fewer runtime errors.
- **Debugging Support:** You can debug LINQ queries like regular .NET code, which is impossible with traditional querying languages like SQL.

##### **Core Components of LINQ:**

- **LINQ to Objects:** This is used to query in-memory collections (e.g., lists and arrays).
- **LINQ to SQL:** This is used to query SQL databases directly from the .NET code.
- **LINQ to XML (XLINQ):** For working with XML data.
- **LINQ to Entities:** This is used to query databases using the Entity Framework, allowing for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) functionality.

##### **Basic LINQ Query Syntax:**

There are two syntaxes available in LINQ: Query Syntax and Method Syntax.

**Query Syntax:** Resembles SQL and is more readable for those familiar with SQL.

```
var result = from element in collection
             where element.SomeProperty > someValue
             select element;
```

**Method Syntax (Fluent API):** Uses extension methods and is often more concise. It can be more powerful and flexible in some scenarios.

```
var result = collection.Where(element => element.SomeProperty > someValue)
                       .Select(element => element);
```

##### **Example to Understand LINQ:**

Assuming you have a list of integers and you want to find all even numbers:

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace PLINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };

            // Query syntax
            var evenNumbersQuery = from num in numbers
                                   where num % 2 == 0
                                   select num;

            Console.WriteLine("Using Query Syntax:");
            foreach (var num in evenNumbersQuery)
            {
                Console.Write($"{num} ");
            }
            Console.WriteLine();

            // Method syntax
            var evenNumbersMethod = numbers.Where(num => num % 2 == 0);
            Console.WriteLine("Using Method Syntax:");
            foreach (var num in evenNumbersMethod)
            {
                Console.Write($"{num} ");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Both of these LINQ queries will give you the same result: a collection of the even numbers [2, 4, 6], as shown in the below image.

##### **What is PLINQ?**

PLINQ, or Parallel Language Integrated Query, is an extension of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) in the .NET framework designed to make parallel and concurrent querying of data more accessible and efficient. It allows developers to perform data operations in parallel on collections that support the IEnumerable<T> interface, allowing multiple processors or cores on a machine to achieve better performance for data-intensive operations.

PLINQ integrates with the standard LINQ to Object queries but extends them to operate parallelly. By simply adding the AsParallel method to a LINQ query, you can convert a traditional sequential LINQ query into a parallel one. PLINQ then handles the partitioning of the data source, the scheduling of tasks across threads, and the aggregation of results, abstracting away the complexity of parallel execution.

#### **Converting LINQ to PLINQ**

Converting LINQ (Language Integrated Query) queries to PLINQ (Parallel LINQ) is a way to improve the performance of data processing operations by taking advantage of multiple cores on modern processors. PLINQ can automatically parallelize queries, but it’s important to use it appropriately because not all operations will benefit from parallelization, and, in some cases, it could even lead to slower performance due to overhead. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide on how to convert a LINQ query to a PLINQ query:

##### **Identify Suitable Queries for Parallelization**

- **Compute-bound queries:** Ideal for PLINQ as they spend significant time processing data, and parallel execution can reduce overall time.
- **Large collections:** The benefits of parallelization are more pronounced on larger datasets.
- **Independent operations:** Ensure the operation does not require sequential access, as the order of execution is not guaranteed in parallel operations.

##### **Convert the LINQ Query to PLINQ**

###### **LINQ Query Example:**

```
var results = from item in dataSource
              where item.SomeCondition()
              select item.SomeTransformation();
```

###### **Converted to PLINQ:**

```
var parallelResults = from item in dataSource.AsParallel()
                      where item.SomeCondition()
                      select item.SomeTransformation();
```

###### **Add Necessary PLINQ Methods**

PLINQ provides several methods to control the behavior of the parallel execution:

- **AsParallel():** Enables parallelization.
- **WithDegreeOfParallelism(int):** Limits the number of parallel tasks.
- **WithExecutionMode(ParallelExecutionMode):** Specifies the execution mode (Default or ForceParallelism).
- **AsOrdered():** Preserves the order of the source sequence.
- **AsSequential():** Returns to sequential execution for methods not supporting parallelization.

##### **Example to Understand Converting LINQ to PLINQ:**

For a better understanding, please modify the Program class as follows. When converting LINQ to PLINQ, careful consideration and testing are crucial to ensure that parallelization benefits the specific scenario. Not all operations will see a performance gain, and understanding the characteristics of the data and the operations performed is key to the successful use of PLINQ.

```
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Linq;

namespace PLINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Creating an in-memory collection
            var numbers = Enumerable.Range(1, 10000000);

            // LINQ Query
            var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
            var linqResults = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 != 0)
                                     .Select(n => n * n)
                                     .ToList();
            stopwatch.Stop();
            Console.WriteLine($"LINQ Query Time: {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms");

            // PLINQ Query
            stopwatch.Restart();
            var plinqResults = numbers.AsParallel()
                                      .Where(n => n % 2 != 0)
                                      .Select(n => n * n)
                                      .ToList();
            stopwatch.Stop();
            Console.WriteLine($"PLINQ Query Time: {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms");

            // Optionally, to verify the results are the same
            // It's a good practice to check if the parallel operation doesn't alter the expected result
            Console.WriteLine($"Are results identical? {linqResults.SequenceEqual(plinqResults)}");

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Explanation:**

- **In-Memory Collection Creation:** The numbers variable represents an in-memory collection of integers from 1 to 10,000,000.
- **LINQ Query Execution:** This function filters out even numbers, squares the remaining numbers, and materializes the result into a list. It also measures the execution time.
- **PLINQ Query Conversion:** Similar operation as the LINQ query, but using AsParallel() to enable parallel execution. Execution time is measured for comparison.
- **Results Comparison:** Optionally, we compare the results from LINQ and PLINQ to ensure they are identical, verifying that parallelization did not affect the correctness of the operation.
- **Performance Measurement:** The execution times for both queries are printed to the console, allowing you to see the performance difference.

Now run the application, and the application will output the execution time of the LINQ and PLINQ queries. It will indicate whether the results are identical, as shown in the below image:

![Example to Understand Converting LINQ to PLINQ](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/word-image-47944-2.png "Example to Understand Converting LINQ to PLINQ")

#### **AsParallel in PLINQ**

AsParallel is a method in PLINQ (Parallel LINQ) that enables parallel execution of LINQ queries in .NET, making it possible to take advantage of multiple processors for performance improvements in certain scenarios. It is particularly useful for processing large data sets or performing computationally intensive operations. Here’s how and when to use AsParallel:

##### **How to Use AsParallel?**

To use AsParallel, you typically start with a LINQ query and insert the AsParallel method call to indicate that the query should be executed in parallel. Here is a basic structure:

```
using System.Linq;
var result = sourceCollection.AsParallel()
                             .Where(item => SomePredicate(item))
                             .Select(item => SomeTransformation(item))
                             .ToList();
```

In this example, sourceCollection is the collection you’re querying. The AsParallel method instructs the system to attempt to execute the subsequent query operators (Where, Select) in parallel. The ToList call at the end materializes the query into a list.

##### **When to Use AsParallel?**

- **Large Data Sets:** Parallel processing can reduce the time it takes to query large collections of data by dividing the work across multiple processors.
- **Computationally Intensive Operations:** If the operations in your query (like those in Where or Select) are CPU-intensive, parallel execution can significantly speed up processing.
- **When You Have Multiple Processors:** Parallel processing is most effective on systems with multiple cores or processors. On a single-core system, parallelization might not improve performance and could even degrade performance due to the overhead of managing parallel tasks.

##### **Implications of AsParallel on Query Performance in LINQ**

Using AsParallel in LINQ (Language Integrated Query) can significantly affect query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. The AsParallel method is a part of PLINQ (Parallel LINQ), allowing LINQ queries to be executed in parallel, utilizing multiple processors on a system. This can lead to improved performance by performing computations in parallel. However, the impact on query performance depends on various factors and can have positive and negative implications.

##### **Positive Implications**

- **Improved Performance on Large Datasets:** For large collections, parallel processing can significantly reduce the time it takes to query data by distributing the workload across multiple threads.
- **Scalability:** Parallel queries can scale with the hardware. As more cores become available, their performance can improve without changing the code.
- **Computationally Intensive Operations:** If the operations in your query (like Where or Select) are CPU-intensive, parallel execution can significantly speed up processing.
- **When You Have Multiple Processors:** Parallel processing is most effective on systems with multiple cores or processors. On a single-core system, parallelization might not improve performance and could even degrade performance due to the overhead of managing parallel tasks.

##### **Negative Implications**

- **Overhead:** Parallel execution incurs overhead for partitioning the data, managing threads, and synchronizing the results. For small datasets, this overhead can outweigh the benefits of parallelization, resulting in poorer performance compared to sequential queries.
- **Complexity and Debugging Difficulty:** Parallel queries can introduce complexity in understanding and debugging the code. Issues such as race conditions and deadlocks become concerns that are not present in sequential processing.
- **Ordering and Side Effects:** When using AsParallel, the execution order is not guaranteed. This can lead to unpredictable results if the query relies on the order of elements. Additionally, queries with side effects (such as modifying a shared resource) can lead to race conditions and data corruption.
- **Resource Contention:** Parallel queries can lead to resource contention, where multiple threads compete for limited resources, such as memory or I/O bandwidth. This can degrade performance, especially if the system is already under heavy load.

##### **Best Practices**

- **Benchmarking:** Always benchmark parallel queries against their sequential counterparts to ensure that parallelization actually offers a performance benefit for your specific scenario.
- **Managing Side Effects:** Avoid side effects in your queries. If side effects are necessary, ensure proper synchronization to avoid data corruption.
- **Customizing Parallelism:** Use methods like WithDegreeOfParallelism to control the number of threads used for processing. This can help manage resource contention and improve performance.

#### **Handling Exceptions in PLINQ Queries**

Handling exceptions in PLINQ (Parallel LINQ) queries is crucial because, unlike LINQ, PLINQ operates on multiple threads. When exceptions occur in such a parallel environment, they can be more challenging to debug and manage. PLINQ aggregates exceptions thrown by the query and wraps them in an AggregateException object. This way, if multiple threads throw exceptions, you don’t lose any of them. Here’s how you can handle exceptions in PLINQ queries:

##### **Basic Exception Handling**

- **Try-Catch Block:** Wrap your PLINQ query execution within a try-catch block specifically designed to catch AggregateException.
- **Flatten:** Since AggregateException can contain other AggregateExceptions as its inner exceptions, calling Flatten() on the caught exception can simplify the structure, making it easier to iterate through all the underlying exceptions.
- **Handle or Iterate Through InnerExceptions:** You have the option to handle each exception individually by iterating through the InnerExceptions collection of the flattened exception, or you can use the Handle(Func<Exception, bool>) method to execute a delegate for each exception.

###### **Example**

Here is a simple example to demonstrate handling exceptions in a PLINQ query:

```
using System;
using System.Linq;

namespace PLINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var numbers = Enumerable.Range(-5, 10); // This will include negative numbers, which will cause an exception when calculating the square root.

            try
            {
                var query = numbers.AsParallel()
                                   .Select(number =>
                                   {
                                       if (number < 0)
                                           throw new ArgumentException($"Invalid number for square root: {number}");
                                       return Math.Sqrt(number);
                                   });

                foreach (var result in query)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(result);
                } 
            }
            catch (AggregateException ae)
            {
                ae.Flatten().Handle(ex =>
                {
                    if (ex is ArgumentException)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
                        return true; // This indicates that the exception was handled.
                    }
                    return false; // This indicates that the exception was not handled here and should be re-thrown.
                });
            }
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

**Here,**

- PLINQ wraps exceptions thrown during query execution in an AggregateException because multiple exceptions could be thrown concurrently from different tasks.
- .Flatten(): This method flattens the AggregateException to make it easier to iterate through all inner exceptions.
- .Handle(…): This method allows handling specific types of exceptions. Here, it checks if the exception is an Argument Exception. If so, it prints the exception message and returns true, indicating the exception has been handled. If the exception is not an Argument Exception, it returns false, which means the exception has not been handled and could be propagated further.

Now, when you run the above code, you will get the following output:

![Handling Exceptions in PLINQ Queries](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/word-image-47944-3.png "Handling Exceptions in PLINQ Queries")

##### **Best Practices**

- **Avoid unnecessary exceptions:** While PLINQ can handle exceptions, it’s best to write code that does not throw exceptions as part of normal control flow in a parallel query.
- **Test for exceptions:** Especially in parallel environments, it’s crucial to test your application thoroughly to ensure that it behaves correctly when exceptions are thrown on multiple threads.
- **Use cancellation tokens:** For long-running queries, consider using cancellation tokens to provide a way to cancel the operation if it encounters too many errors or for other reasons.

#### **Multiple Basic PLINQ Examples**

PLINQ, or Parallel LINQ, is an extension of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) that allows you to perform parallel data processing in .NET. It can significantly improve the performance of data query operations by utilizing multiple processors or cores. I’ll provide you with multiple basic examples to illustrate how PLINQ can be used in various scenarios.

##### **Example: Basic Parallel Query**

This example demonstrates a simple PLINQ query that converts each item in a collection to uppercase in parallel.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace PLINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var source = new List<string> { "apple", "orange", "banana", "grape" };

            var parallelQuery = from fruit in source.AsParallel()
                                select fruit.ToUpper();

            foreach (var fruit in parallelQuery)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(fruit);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Example: Forcing Parallel Execution**

Sometimes, PLINQ may decide not to parallelize a query if it believes doing so wouldn’t be beneficial. You can force parallelism using the WithExecutionMode method:

```
using System;
using System.Linq;

namespace PLINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var numbers = Enumerable.Range(1, 20);

            var parallelQuery = from num in numbers.AsParallel().WithExecutionMode(ParallelExecutionMode.ForceParallelism)
                                where num % 2 == 0
                                select num;

            foreach (var num in parallelQuery)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(num);
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Example: Limiting Degree of Parallelism**

You might want to limit the number of processors used in a parallel query. This is how you can do it:

```
using System;
using System.Linq;

namespace PLINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var numbers = Enumerable.Range(1, 20);

            var parallelQuery = numbers.AsParallel()
                                       .WithDegreeOfParallelism(2) // Limits to 2 cores
                                       .Where(n => n % 2 == 0);

            foreach (var num in parallelQuery)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(num);
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Example: Ordered PLINQ Query**

By default, PLINQ processes data in parallel without preserving the order of the source collection. If order is important, you can use AsOrdered:

```
using System;
using System.Linq;

namespace PLINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var numbers = Enumerable.Range(1, 20);

            var parallelQuery = from num in numbers.AsParallel().AsOrdered()
                                where num % 2 == 0
                                select num;

            foreach (var num in parallelQuery)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(num);
            }
            
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Differences Between LINQ and PLINQ**

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and PLINQ (Parallel LINQ) are part of the .NET framework, designed to make data querying across various sources easier, more consistent, and readable. Despite their similarities in syntax and purpose, they serve different needs regarding data querying and manipulation. Here are the main differences between LINQ and PLINQ:

##### **Execution Mode**

- **LINQ:** Executes queries sequentially on a single thread. Each element in the collection is processed one at a time, which is straightforward but might not be optimal for performance with large datasets or complex queries.
- **PLINQ:** Executes queries in parallel using multiple threads, using multi-core processors to improve performance for large datasets or computationally intensive queries.

##### **Performance**

- **LINQ** is better suited for smaller datasets or when parallel execution might not offer significant performance improvements due to overhead or the nature of the operation. The overhead of setting up parallel tasks can sometimes make LINQ faster for less complex queries.
- **PLINQ** can significantly reduce execution time for large datasets and complex queries by distributing work across available cores. However, not all operations will benefit from parallel execution; in some cases, the overhead of managing parallel tasks can outweigh the benefits.

##### **Ordering**

- **LINQ** Maintains the order of the collection by default, making it predictable but potentially slower for some operations that don’t inherently require ordering.
- **PLINQ** does not guarantee the order of results by default because of the parallel nature of its execution. However, it provides options to preserve ordering at the cost of performance.

##### **Error Handling**

- **LINQ:** Errors are thrown immediately when encountered during the execution of a query.
- **PLINQ:** Errors may not surface until the query is fully executed because of its parallel nature. All exceptions thrown by tasks are aggregated into an AggregateException, which is then thrown.

##### **Use Cases**

- **LINQ** is Ideal for querying databases, XML documents, arrays, and more, where performance is not the critical concern or when working with operations that must execute sequentially.
- **PLINQ** is best suited for data-intensive operations that can be parallelized to improve performance, such as processing large collections of data in memory.

##### **Compatibility and Safety**

- **LINQ:** Generally, no special considerations are needed for thread safety unless the underlying data source is being modified concurrently.
- **PLINQ:** Requires careful consideration of thread safety, as multiple operations may attempt to read from or write to shared resources concurrently.

##### **Conclusion**

The choice between LINQ and PLINQ should be based on the specific requirements of the task, including the size of the dataset, the complexity of the operations, the need for maintaining order, and the potential for performance improvement through parallel execution. PLINQ offers a powerful option for enhancing performance but comes with considerations around ordering, error handling, and thread safety that don’t typically apply to LINQ.

In the next article, I will discuss [**Deep Dive into PLINQ Operations**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/deep-dive-into-plinq-operations/). In this article, I explain **how to get started with PLINQ**. I hope you enjoy this article about getting started with PLINQ.
