##### **LINQ ThenBy and ThenByDescending Method in C#:**

The ThenBy and ThenByDescending methods in LINQ are used for secondary sorting in C# and other .NET languages. These methods come into play when you want to sort a collection based on multiple criteria. They are typically used after OrderBy or OrderByDescending to provide further sorting on the elements of a collection.

That means if you want to sort the data by multiple keys, the first key will be sorted by the OrderBy or OrderByDescending method. And then, from the second key onwards, the data will be sorted by ThenBy and ThenByDescending methods. You can use the ThenBy or ThenByDescending method more than once in the same LINQ query, but you can use the OrderBy or OrderByDescending methods only once in the same query.

##### **Examples to Understand LINQ ThenBy and ThenByDescending Methods in C#****:**

The OrderBy or OrderByDescending method is generally used for primary sorting. The ThenBy or ThenByDescending Methods are used for secondary sorting. For example, sort the student by First Name and then sort the student by Last Name. In this case, the First Name needs to be sorted by the OrderBy or OrderByDescending method, and the Last Name needs to be sorted by the ThenBy or ThenByDescending method based on our requirements.

We will use ThenBy or ThenByDescending methods, so we need to work with Complex types. It is not possible to use these two methods with primitive data types as we are going to sort the data based on multiple keys. So, let us see how we can work with Complex data types using LINQ ThenBy or ThenByDescending methods. We will use the following Student class to understand the use of the ThenBy and ThenByDescending methods in C#. So, create a class file named **Student.cs** and copy and paste the following code.

```
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        public string Branch { get; set; }

        public static List<Student> GetAllStudents()
        {
            List<Student> listStudents = new List<Student>()
            {
                new Student{ID= 101,FirstName = "Preety",LastName = "Tiwary",Branch = "CSE"},
                new Student{ID= 102,FirstName = "Preety",LastName = "Agrawal",Branch = "ETC"},
                new Student{ID= 103,FirstName = "Priyanka",LastName = "Dewangan",Branch = "ETC"},
                new Student{ID= 104,FirstName = "Hina",LastName = "Sharma",Branch = "ETC"},
                new Student{ID= 105,FirstName = "Anugrag",LastName = "Mohanty",Branch = "CSE"},
                new Student{ID= 106,FirstName = "Anurag",LastName = "Sharma",Branch = "CSE"},
                new Student{ID= 107,FirstName = "Pranaya",LastName = "Kumar",Branch = "CSE"},
                new Student{ID= 108,FirstName = "Manoj",LastName = "Kumar",Branch = "ETC"},
                new Student{ID= 109,FirstName = "Pranaya",LastName = "Rout",Branch = "ETC"},
                new Student{ID= 110,FirstName = "Saurav",LastName = "Rout",Branch = "CSE"}
            };

            return listStudents;
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, we created the above Student class with four properties: **ID, FirstName, LastName,** and **Brach**. We then created one method, i.e., **GetAllStudents(),** which will return a list of students, which will be our data source, and on this data source, we will perform our operations.

##### **Example to Understand LINQ ThenBy Method Using Method Syntax in C#:**

Our requirement is to sort the student by First Name in Ascending Order, and then we need to sort the student by Last Name in Ascending order. So, here, we will sort the data based on two keys, i.e., FirstName and LastName. So, in this case, the first sorting will be done by the OrderBy method, and the second will be done by the ThenBy method, as shown in the example below.

```
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Sorting the Student data by First Name and LastName in Descending Order
            //Using Method Syntax
            var MS = Student.GetAllStudents()
                            .OrderBy(x => x.FirstName)
                            .ThenBy(y => y.LastName)
                            .ToList();

            foreach (var student in MS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("First Name :" + student.FirstName + ", Last Name : " + student.LastName);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Run the above application, and you will get the following output. Here, you can observe a few students, such as Anurag, Pranaya, and Preety, who have the same first names and different last names. For those students, first, it will sort them using their First Name, and then it will sort them using their Last Name, which you can see in the image below.

##### **Example to Understand LINQ ThenBy Method Using Query Syntax in C#**

We do not have any operators called ThenBy and ThenByDescending, which we can use in the query syntax. So here, we need to specify multiple values or expressions in the order by clause separated by a comma, as shown in the below example.

```
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Sorting the Student data by First Name and Last Name in Descending Order
            //Using Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in Student.GetAllStudents()
                      orderby std.FirstName, std.LastName
                      select std);

            foreach (var student in QS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("First Name :" + student.FirstName + ", Last Name : " + student.LastName);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, run the above code, which will also give you the same output as expected, as shown in the image below.

![Example to Understand LINQ ThenBy Method Using Query Syntax in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22522%22%20height=%22247%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Example to Understand LINQ ThenBy Method Using Query Syntax in C#")

##### **Example to Understand Ascending and Descending with Multiple Key Values:**

Let us see an example of how we can Perform the Ascending and Descending Operation with Multiple Key Values using Method and Query Syntax in C#. Our requirement is that we need to first sort the students in ascending order based on the Branch. Then, we must sort the students in descending order based on their First Names. And finally, we need to sort the students in ascending order based on their Last Names. The following example exactly does the same.

```
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //First Sort Students in Ascending Order Based on Branch
            //Then Sort Students in Descending Order Based on FirstName
            //Finally Sort Students in Ascending Order Based on LastName

            //Using Method Syntax
            var MS = Student.GetAllStudents()
                     .OrderBy(x => x.Branch)
                     .ThenByDescending(y => y.FirstName)
                     .ThenBy(z => z.LastName)
                     .ToList();

            //Using Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in Student.GetAllStudents()
                      orderby std.Branch ascending,
                              std.FirstName descending,
                              std.LastName //by default ascending
                      select std).ToList();

            foreach (var student in QS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Barnch " + student.Branch + ", First Name :" + student.FirstName + ", Last Name : " + student.LastName);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, run the application, and you will get the following output as expected.

![Example to Understand Ascending and Descending with Multiple Key Values](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22667%22%20height=%22243%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Example to Understand Ascending and Descending with Multiple Key Values")

##### **Key Points to Rember:**

- The ThenBy is used when youâ€™ve already sorted your collection using OrderBy, and you want to sort the collection further based on another criterion in ascending order.
- The ThenByDescending is similar to ThenBy, but it sorts the secondary criterion in descending order.
- Both ThenBy and ThenByDescending can only be used after OrderBy or OrderByDescending. They rely on an initial sorting performed by these methods.
- You can chain multiple ThenBy or ThenByDescending calls to sort by additional criteria.
- The sorting is stable, meaning that if two elements are equal according to the sorting criteria, their relative order will be the same as it was in the original collection.
- Like other LINQ methods, the sorting is deferred until the collection is enumerated (e.g., with a for each loop, ToList(), ToArray(), etc.).

##### **Example Using ThenBy and ThenByDescending Method with Where Extension Method:**

Let us see an example to understand how we can use the LINQ ThenBy and ThenByDescending Method with the Where Extension Method in C#. Our requirement is first to fetch only the CSE branch students, and then we need to sort the data as follows.

1. First, sort the students in ascending order based on First Name.
2. Then, sort the students in descending order based on their Last Names.

The following example code exactly does the same.

```
using System;
using System.Linq;
namespace LINQDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //First, fetch only the CSE branch students
            //Sort the Students in ascending order based on First Name
            //Sort the students in descending order based on their Last Names

            //Using Method Syntax
            var MS = Student.GetAllStudents()
                     .Where(std => std.Branch == "CSE")
                     .OrderBy(x => x.FirstName)
                     .ThenByDescending(y => y.LastName)
                     .ToList();

            //Using Query Syntax
            var QS = (from std in Student.GetAllStudents()
                      where std.Branch == "CSE"
                      orderby std.FirstName, //By Default it is Ascending
                              std.LastName descending
                      select std).ToList();

            foreach (var student in QS)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Barnch " + student.Branch + ", First Name :" + student.FirstName + ", Last Name : " + student.LastName);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

Now, run the application, and you will get the following output as expected.

##### **When to Use LINQ ThenBy and ThenByDescending Method in C#?**

The LINQ ThenBy and ThenByDescending methods are used for secondary sorting in C# and other .NET languages. They come into play when you need to sort a collection based on multiple criteria. Hereâ€™s when and why you would use them:

- **Secondary Sorting After Primary Sorting:** The most common use case is when you have sorted a collection using OrderBy or OrderByDescending and want to apply a secondary sort criterion. For example, sort a list of employees by their department (primary sort) and then by their name (secondary sort).
- **Sorting Complex Objects by Multiple Properties:** In collections of complex objects, you might need to sort by more than one property. For instance, you could sort a list of products by category and then by price. ThenBy is used for ascending secondary sorting, and ThenByDescending for descending.
- **Improving Data Organization for Display or Processing:** Secondary sorting can make the data more understandable and easier to analyze when presenting data in tables or reports. Itâ€™s also helpful in processing where the order of elements matters.
- **Grouping and Sorting within Groups:** GroupBy, ThenBy, and ThenByDescending can be used to sort within each group. For instance, grouping orders by status and then sorting them by date within each group.
- **Database Queries in Entity Framework or LINQ to SQL:** In the context of database querying, these methods translate to SQL clauses that handle sorting at the database level, which can be more efficient for large datasets.
- **Handling Ties in Sorting:** They are particularly useful in scenarios where sorting by a single criterion might result in ties. Secondary sorting helps in providing a deterministic and meaningful order in such cases.
- **Organizing Data for Better Readability:** Secondary sorting makes the data more readable and logical. For instance, sorting a list of employees by department and alphabetically by their names.
