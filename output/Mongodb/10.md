## **Replace Document in MongoDB with Examples**

In this article, I am going to discuss **Replace Document in MongoDB** with Examples. Please read our previous article where we discussed [**Inserting Documents in MongoDB**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/inserting-documents-in-mongodb/) with Examples.

##### **Replace Document in MongoDB**

MongoDB documents are also known as BSON documents that are used to store data. The document is created using field-value pairs or key-value pairs and the value is of any BSON type. Here BSON document means the binary representation of JSON document.

**db.collection.replaceOne()** is used to replace a single document with another document according to the given filter. It does not modify the existing document instead it replaces the whole document with the new one.

- This function will replace the first document that matched the given filter.
- This method replaces one document at a time.
- If the value of upsert is true and no document matches the given filter, then this function will add the replacement document as a new document in the collection.
- In the capped collection if the replaceOne document changes the size of the document then the operation is failed.
- You are not allowed to use replaceOne() function in the time series collections.
- You are allowed to use this function in multi-document transactions.

**Syntax:**
**db.collection.replaceOne(<filter>, <newdocument>,**
**{upset: <boolean>,**
**writeConcern: <document>,**
**collation: <document>,**
**hint: <document|string>}**
**)**

###### **Parameter:**

This function takes the following parameters:

1. Filter: It represents the selection criteria. If the value of this field is an empty document({}), then it will replace the very first document of the collection with the new one.
2. upsert: It is an optional parameter. By default, it is false. If its value is true, then replaceOne() either insert a replacement document as a new document in the collection if no document matches the given filter. Or replace the old document with the replacement document that matches the given filter.
3. writeConcern: It is an optional parameter. It removes the use of default write concern.
4. collation: It is an optional parameter. It is used to specify the collation used for the operation.
5. hint: It is an optional parameter. It is a document or a string that is used to specify the index to use to support the filter.

###### **Return Value:**

This function will return a document that contains the following fields with values:

1. **acknowledged**: The value of this field is true when the insert operation ran with write concern. Otherwise, it will return false.
2. **matchedCount**: It represents the total number of matched documents.
3. **modifiedCount**: It represents the total number of modified documents.
4. **upsertedID**: It represents the \_id for the upserted document.

##### **Sample Database**

In the following examples we use the following database:

##### **Example – Replace First Document in MongoDB**

Here in the below example, we replace the very first document of the author’s collection with the new document.

**db.authors.replaceOne({}, {name: “Sohan”, group:”C”, tutorial:”C++”, articleNumber:90})**

##### **Example – Replace a document with a new document that matches the filter**

Here in the below example, we replace the first document that matches the filter that is the name of the author is “Punit” with the new document.

**db.authors.replaceOne({“name.fName”:”Punit”}, {name: “Pihu”, group:”C”, tutorial:”C#”, articleNumber:90})**

##### **Example – Insert a New Document in MongoDB**

Here in the below example, we insert a new document in the author’s collection because no document was found with the name “Punit” in the author’s collection also the value of upsert is set to true.

**db.authors.replaceOne({“name.fName”:”Punit”}, {name: “Mona”, group:”C”, tutorial:”C”, articleNumber:90},**

**… {upsert: true})**
