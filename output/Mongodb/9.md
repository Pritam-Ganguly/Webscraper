## **Inserting Documents in MongoDB with Examples**

In this article, I am going to discuss **Inserting Documents in MongoDB** with Examples. Please read our previous article where we discussed [**How MongoDB Works**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/how-mongodb-works/).

##### **Inserting Documents in MongoDB**

MongoDB documents are also known as BSON documents that are used to store data. The document is created using field-value pairs or key-value pairs and the value is of any BSON type. Here BSON document means the binary representation of JSON document.

To insert a document in the MongoDB Database we use the insert operation. It will insert a new document in the specified collection. If the specified collection does not exist, then the insert operation will also create a new collection by adding a new document to it. To insert a document, we can use any of the following methods:

**db.collection.insertOne()**
**db.collection.insertMany()**

##### **Inserting Single Document in MongoDB**

**db.collection.insertOne()** method is used to insert a single document in the collection.

- You are allowed to add a document with or without the \_id field. If you insert a document without an \_id field, then MongoDB will automatically assign an \_id field to the document with a unique objectId.
- The value of the \_id field must be unique inside the collection to avoid getting duplicate key errors. \_id key is just like the primary key in SQL.
- This function is not compatible with db.collection.explain().
- You can use this function inside the multi-document transactions.
- When an error occurs, this function will throw either writeError or writeConcernError exception.

**Syntax:** **db.collection.insertOne(<document>, {writeConcern: <document>})**

###### **Parameter:**

This function takes two parameters:

1. **Document**: It represents the document that we want to insert into the database.
2. **writeConcern**: It is an optional parameter. It removes the use of default write concern.

###### **Return value:**

This function will return a document that contains the following fields with values:

1. **acknowledged**: The value of this field is true when the insert operation ran with write concern. Otherwise, it will return false.
2. **insertedId**: The value of this field is the \_id value of the inserted document.

##### **Example- Inserting Single Document without \_id field in MongoDB**

Here, in this example, we insert a single document in the company database without the \_id field.

**db.company.insertOne({“Name”: “Moti”, “Group”:”D”, “Division”:345})**

##### **Example – Inserting single document with \_id field in MongoDB**

Here, in this example, we insert a single document in the company database with the \_id field.

**db.company.insertOne({\_id: 23456, “Name”: “Soma”, “Group”:”C”, “Division”:39})**

##### **Inserting Multiple Documents in MongoDB**

**db.collection.insertMany()** method is used to insert multiple documents in the collection. In this method, multiple documents are inserted in an array.

- You are allowed to add a document with or without the \_id field. If you insert a document without an \_id field, then MongoDB will automatically assign an \_id field to the document with a unique objectId.
- The value of the \_id field must be unique inside the collection to avoid getting duplicate key errors. \_id key is just like the primary key in SQL.
- Documents are inserted in order format. If the value of the ordered parameter is false, then only documents are inserted in an unordered format.
- This function is not compatible with db.collection.explain().
- You can use this function inside the multi-document transaction.
- When an error occurs, this function will throw a BulkWriteError exception. It also throws either writeError or writeConcernError exception.

**Syntax:** **db.collection.insertMany([<document1>,<document2>..], {writeConcern: <document>, ordered: <boolean>})**

###### **Parameter:**

This function takes two parameters:

1. **Documents**: It represents an array of documents that we want to insert into the database.
2. **writeConcern**: It is an optional parameter. It removes the use of default write concern.
3. **ordered**: It is also an optional parameter. It is used to tell mongod or mongosh to insert documents in ordered or unordered format. The default value of this parameter is true.

###### **Return value:**

This function will return a document that contains the following fields with values:

1. **acknowledged**: The value of this field is true when the insert operation ran with write concern. Otherwise, it will return false.
2. **insertedId array**: The value of this field is the \_id value of the successfully inserted documents.

##### **Example – Inserting a single document without the \_id field in MongoDB**

Here, in this example, we insert a single document in the company database without the \_id field.

**db.company.insertMany([{Name: “Monti”, Group: “A”, Division: 34}, {Name: “Push”, Group:”C”, Division: 39}])**

##### **Example – Inserting single document with \_id field in MongoDB**

Here, in this example, we insert a single document in the company database with the \_id field.

**db.company.insertMany([{\_id:234, Name: “Somiya”, Group: “A”, Division: 34}, {\_id:123, Name: “Sonil”, Group:”D”, Division: 348},{\_id:235, Name:”Ponit”, Group: “F”, Division: 344}])**

In the next article, I am going to discuss [**Replace Document in MongoDB**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/replace-document-in-mongodb/) with Examples. Here, in this article, I try to explain **Inserting Documents in MongoDB** with Examples. I hope you enjoy this Inserting Documents in MongoDB with Examples article.
