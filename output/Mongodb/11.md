## **Deleting Document in MongoDB with Examples**

In this article, I am going to discuss **Deleting Documents in MongoDB** with Examples. Please read our previous article where we discussed [**Replace Document in MongoDB**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/replace-document-in-mongodb/) with Examples.

##### **Deleting Document in MongoDB**

MongoDB documents are also known as BSON documents that are used to store data. The document is created using field-value pairs or key-value pairs and the value is of any BSON type. Here BSON document means the binary representation of JSON document.

To remove a document from the MongoDB Database we use the delete operation. It will delete an existing document from the specified collection. To delete a document, we can use any of the following methods:

**db.collection.deleteOne()**
**db.collection.deleteMany()**

##### **Removing Single Document in MongoDB**

**db.collection.deleteOne()** is used to delete the first document or a single document that matches the given filter.

- It removes the first document that matches the given filter.
- If we use this function in the capped collection, then it will return the WriteError exception.
- If we use this function in the time series collection, then it will return the WriteError exception.
- If you use this function in the shared collection, then it is necessary to include the shared key in the query specification.
- You can use this function inside the multi-document transaction.
- It deletes only one document at a time.

**Syntax:** **db.collection.deleteOne(<Filter>, {writeConcern: <document>, collation:<document>, hint:<document|string>})**

###### **Parameter:**

This function takes the following parameters:

1. **Filter**: It represents the deletion criteria. If the value of this field is the empty document({}), then it will delete the very first document of the collection.
2. **writeConcern**: It is an optional parameter. It removes the use of default write concern.
3. **collation**: It is an optional parameter. It is used to specify the collation used for the operation.
4. **hint**: It is an optional parameter. It is a document or a string that is used to specify the index to use to support the filter.

###### **Return Value:**

This function will return a document that contains the following fields with values:

1. **acknowledged**: The value of this field is true when the insert operation ran with write concern. Otherwise, it will return false.
2. **deleteCount**: It represents the total number of deleted documents.

##### **Sample Database**

In the below examples we use the following database:

![Deleting Document in MongoDB with Examples](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221043%22%20height=%22310%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Deleting Document in MongoDB with Examples")

##### **Example – Delete Single Document in MongoDB**

Here in the below example, we delete the first document of the company collection.

**db.company.deleteOne({})**

##### **Example – Delete a document according to the filter**

Here in the below example, we delete the first document that matches the filter which is Group: “C”.

**db.company.deleteOne({Group:”C”})**

![Example - Delete a document according to the filter](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221120%22%20height=%22295%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Example - Delete a document according to the filter")

##### **Removing Multiple Documents in MongoDB**

**db.collection.deleteMany()** is used to delete multiple existing documents from the specified collection.

- If we use this function without any filter document, then it will delete all the documents present in the given collection.
- If we use this function in the capped collection, then it will return the WriteError exception.
- If we use this function in the time series collection, then it will return the WriteError exception.
- If you use this function in the shared collection, then it is necessary to include the shared key in the query specification.
- You can use this function inside multi-document transactions.

**Syntax:** **db.collection.deleteMany(<Filter>, {writeConcern: <document>, collation:<document>})**

###### **Parameter:**

This function takes the following parameters:

1. **Filter**: It represents the deletion criteria. If the value of this field is the empty document({}), then it will delete the very first document of the collection.
2. **writeConcern**: It is an optional parameter. It removes the use of default write concern.
3. **collation**: It is an optional parameter. It is used to specify the collation used for the operation.

###### **Return value:**

This function will return a document that contains the following fields with values:

1. **acknowledged**: The value of this field is true when the insert operation ran with write concern. Otherwise, it will return false.
2. **deleteCount**: It represents the total number of deleted documents.

##### **Sample Database**

In the below examples we use the following database:

![Removing Multiple Documents in MongoDB](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221204%22%20height=%22377%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Removing Multiple Documents in MongoDB")

##### **Example – Deleting all the documents that match the given filter in MongoDB**

Here in the below example, we delete all the documents that match the given filter which is Division:34.

**db.company.deleteMany({Division:34})**

![Example - Deleting all the documents that match the given filter in MongoDB](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221202%22%20height=%22207%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Example - Deleting all the documents that match the given filter in MongoDB")

##### **Example 2 – Deleting All Documents in MongoDB**

Here, in the below example, we delete all the documents from the given collection.

**db.company.deleteMany({})**

![Example 2 - Deleting All Documents in MongoDB](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221178%22%20height=%22214%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Example 2 - Deleting All Documents in MongoDB")In the next article, I am going to discuss [**Embedded Documents in MongoDB**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/embedded-documents-in-mongodb/) with Examples. Here, in this article, I try to explain **Deleting Documents in MongoDB** with Examples. I hope you enjoy this Deleting Documents in MongoDB with Examples article.
