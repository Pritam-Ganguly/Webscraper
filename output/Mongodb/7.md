## **Comparing JSON and BSON in MongoDB**

In this article, I am going to discuss what is the difference between **JSON and BSON File Formats in MongoDB**. Please read our previous article where we discussed [**How to Create MongoDB Documents**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/mongodb-documents/) with Examples.

##### **Comparing JSON and BSON in MongoDB**

**JSON:** JSON is known as JavaScript Object Notation. It is a human-readable data interchange format. It is a language-independent file format and is lightweight. It is the commonly used data format for asynchronous browser-server communication. Using JSON, we can also send information very easily. It is a combination of key/value pairs and an array. We can also allow to embedded one JSON document into another up to a maximum of 100 documents. String, numbers, array true, false, null, object, etc. are some data types that are supported by JSON.

**BSON:** BSON is known as Binary-JSON. It is a binary format so it is not in a human-readable format. BSON is used to encrypt JSON data. It can be easily parsed and provide additional datatypes over the JSON. It is a language-independent file format and is lightweight. It can traverse easily across the network. Or we can say that it is a binary structure that encodes type and length information and can be traversed must more quickly as compared to JSON.

##### **Comparing JSON and BSON in MongoDB**

| JSON | BSON |
| --- | --- |
| It stands for JavaScript Object Notation | It stands for Binary JavaScript Object Notation |
| It is a standard file format type. | It is a binary file format type. |
| Some basic data types supported by JSON: string number, Boolean, null, etc. | Some basic data types supported by BSON: date, timestamp, etc. |
| It is slower than JSON | It is faster than JSON |
| It consumes more space as compared to BSON | It consumes less space as compare to JSON |
| JSON used for the transmission of data | BSON is used for storing data |
| It does not have encoding and decoding techniques | It has faster encoded and decoding techniques. |
| Databases like AnyDB, redid, etc use JSON format to store data. | MongoDB uses BSON format to store data |
| It does not require to be parsed because it is already in a human-readable format. | It does require to be parsed and it can be parsed easily by the machines. |
| In a JSON file, if you want to read any specific information then you must go through the whole content. | In a BSON file, you can use indexes to read a piece of specific information. With the help of indexes, you need not go through all the content, it will return only the specified information. |

In the next article, I am going to discuss [**How MongoDB Works**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/how-mongodb-works/). Here, in this article, I try to explain what is the difference between **JSON and BSON File Formats in MongoD**B. I hope you enjoy the JSON and BSON file formats in the MongoDB article.
