## **MongoDB Greater Than ($gt) Operator**

In this article, we will discuss **MongoDB Greater Than ($gt) Operator** with Examples. In MongoDB, data is stored in the BSON document. Here BSON is known as the binary document or binary representation of JSON document. BSON supports various types of values like strings, integers, etc. So to compare these values MongoDB provides comparison operators. Comparison operators return the values according to the value comparisons. MongoDB supports various comparison operators like $eq, $gt, $gte, $in, $lt, $lte, $ne, and $nin. 

##### **MongoDB Greater Than ($gt) Operator**

MongoDB $gt operator is known as greater than. This operator selects only those documents whose field value is greater than the specified value. This operator generally works on BSON data types.

**Syntax:** **{$gt: value}**

Now we will learn how to use the $gt operator with the help of the following examples. So in this article to understand the MongoDB Greater Than ($gt) Operator, we are going to use the following database:

![MongoDB Greater Than ($gt) Operator](https://dotnettutorials.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image.jpeg "MongoDB Greater Than ($gt) Operator")

Here the collection name is embeddedColl and it contains 6 documents.

##### **Example- Matching Document Fields**

To select all the documents in the embeddedColl collection whose count is greater than 40 we use the find() function along with the $gt operator.

**db.embeddedColl.find({Count:{$gt:40}}).pretty()**

###### **Output:**

**![Example- Matching document fields](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221026%22%20height=%22462%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Example- Matching document fields")**

##### **Example-Update Document Field**

To update a document in the embeddedColl collection whose Count is greater than 40 with year = 2022. So we use updateOne() function along with the $gt operator.

**db.embeddedColl.updateOne({Count:{$gt:40}}, {$set:{year: 2022}})**

Here, {Count:{$gt:40}} is a filter document, and {$set:{year: 2022}} is updating the value of the field with the new one. Here updateOne() function updates one document at a time.

###### **Output:**

**![Image](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221014%22%20height=%22504%22%3E%3C/svg%3E)**

##### **Example- Update Embedded Document Field**

To update the field of embedded documents in the embeddedColl collection whose Count is greater than 45 with year = 2022. So we use the updateMany() function along with the $gt operator.

**db.embeddedColl.updateMany({“Articles.Count”:{$gt:45}}, {$set:{year: 2022}})**

###### **Output:**

![Example- Update Embedded Document Field](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221032%22%20height=%221350%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Example- Update Embedded Document Field")

The updateMany() function updates multiple documents at a time. So in the above example, the updateMany() function updates two documents with year:2022 because they satisfy the filter document that is {“Articles.Count”:{$gt:45}}.

In the next article, I am going to discuss [**MongoDB Less Than ($lt) Operator**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/mongodb-less-than-operator/) with Examples. Here, in this article, I try to explain **MongoDB Greater Than ($gt) Operator** with Examples. I hope you enjoy this MongoDB Greater Than ($gt) Operator with Examples article.
