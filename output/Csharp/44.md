## **Difference Between Convert.ToString and ToString Method in C#**

In this article, I am going to discuss the **Difference Between Convert.ToString and ToString Method in C#** with Examples. Please read our previous article before proceeding to this article where we discussed why and how to override the **[Equals Method in C#](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/why-we-should-override-equals-method/)** with examples. 

##### **Convert.ToString and ToString Method in C#**

Both these methods are used to convert a value to a string. The difference is **Convert.ToString()** method handles null whereas the **ToString()** doesn’t handle null in C#.

In C# if you declare a **string variable** and if you **don’t assign any value** to that variable, then by default that variable takes a **null** value. In such a case, if you use the **ToString()** method then your program will throw the **Null Reference Exception.** On the other hand, if you use the **Convert.ToString()** method then your program will not throw an exception.

###### **Let us understand the Difference Between these two methods with an example.**

```
using System;
namespace UnderstandingToStringMethod
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Customer C1 = null;
            C1.ToString();
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
    public class Customer
    {
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

**When you run the application, it will give you the following error**

![Difference Between Convert.ToString and ToString Method in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22859%22%20height=%22486%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Difference Between Convert.ToString and ToString Method in C#")

This is because the **ToString()** method in C# expects the object to be not NULL on which it is invoking. In our example object, **C1 is Null** and we are invoking the **ToString()** on the **NULL object**, so it gives **NULL Reference exception**.

##### **Let see another example.**

```
using System;
namespace UnderstandingToStringMethod
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            String Name = null;
            Name.ToString();
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
}
```

When we execute the above program, it also gives us the same **NULL Reference Exception** as shown below.

![Convert.ToString and ToString Method in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22868%22%20height=%22378%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Convert.ToString and ToString Method in C#")

This is because the Name variable is Null and we are invoking the ToString() method. Let see what happens when we use the **Convert.Tostring()** method with the above two examples.

```
using System;
namespace UnderstandingObjectClassMethods
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            Customer C1 = null;
            Convert.ToString(C1);

            String Name = null;
            Convert.ToString(Name);

            Console.WriteLine("No Error");
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
    public class Customer
    {
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Now, with the above changes, run the application and it should be executed without any error. So in short, the **Convert.ToString()** method handles null, while the **ToString()** method doesn’t handle the Null and throws an exception. So it’s always a good programming practice to use the **Convert.ToString()** method which will take care of the Null values and it is also safe to use.

Here, in this article, I try to explain the **difference between the Convert.ToString and ToString Method in C#** with Examples. I hope this article will help you with your needs. I would like to have your feedback. Please post your feedback, question, or comments about this Difference Between Convert.ToString and ToString Method in C# article.

Then, When do we use .ToString() method rather than the Convert.ToString()?

.ToString() method should be used when you are certain that user will enter data into the field that you are trying to convert. When there is uncertainty, you should use Convert.ToString()

Well explained
But I have a question….
suppose we have a class with some properties defined using get, set
public class Test
{
public string? name {get; set;}
}
–Now if I make a object of this class and apply Convert.ToString() directly on it —– it will throw exception why?
Test obj = new Test()
{
name = null
}

Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToString( obj.name )) // will throw exception why?

namespace Abstract
{
class A
{
public static void Main()
{
Test test = new Test()
{
name = null
};
Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToString(test.name));
}
}
public class Test
{
public string? name { get; set; }
}
}

I Tried running this code its working
