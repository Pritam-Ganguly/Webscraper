## **How to Sort a List of Complex Types in C#**

In this article, I am going to discuss **How to Sort a List of Complex Types in C#** like Employee, Customer, Product, Department, etc. with examples. Please read our previous article where we discussed [**Generic List in C#**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/list-collection-csharp/) with Examples. Before understanding, how to sort a complex type, let us first understand how to sort simple types like int, double, char, string, etc.

##### **Generic List<T> Collection Class Sort Methods in C#:**

The Generic List Collection Class in C# provides the following four Sort Methods.

1. **Sort():** This method is used to sort the elements in the entire Generic List using the default comparer.
2. **Sort(IComparer<T> comparer):** This method is used to sort the elements in the entire Generic List using the specified comparer.
3. **Sort(Comparison<T> comparison):** This method is used to sort the elements in the entire Generic List using the specified System.Comparison.
4. **Sort(int index, int count, IComparer<T> comparer):** This method is used to sort the elements in a range of elements in a Generic List using the specified comparer.

##### **How to Sort a List of Simple Types in C#:**

Sorting a generic list collection of simple types is very straightforward. We just need to invoke the Sort() method (Provided by the Generic List class) on the list instance and the data will be automatically sorted in ascending order. For example, if we have a list of integers as shown below
**List<int> numbersList = new List<int>{ 1, 8, 7, 5, 2 };**

Then we just need to invoke the Sort() method on numbersList collection as shown below
**numbersList.Sort();**

If you want the data to be retrieved in descending order, then after calling the Sort method, you need to call the Reverse() method on the list instance as shown below.
**numbersList.Reverse();**

##### **Example to Understand How to Sort a List Collection of Simple Types in C#:**

In the below example, we are creating list collections of int and string types and then calling the Sort Method to Sort the collection and the Reverse Method to reverse the collection.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace ListCollectionSortReverseMethodDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            List<int> numbersList = new List<int> { 1, 8, 7, 5, 2 };
            Console.WriteLine("Numbers Before Sorting");
            foreach (int i in numbersList)
            {
                Console.Write($"{i} ");
            }

            // The Sort() of List Collection class will sort the data in ascending order 
            numbersList.Sort();
            Console.WriteLine("\n\nNumbers After Sorting");
            foreach (int i in numbersList)
            {
                Console.Write($"{i} ");
            }

            // If you want to retrieve data in descending order then use the Reverse() method
            numbersList.Reverse();
            Console.WriteLine("\n\nNumbers in Descending order");
            foreach (int i in numbersList)
            {
                Console.Write($"{i} ");
            }

            //Another Example of Sorting String
            List<string> names = new List<string>() { "Pranaya", "Anurag", "Sambit", "Hina", "Rakesh" };
            Console.WriteLine("\n\nNames Before Sorting");
            foreach (string name in names)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(name);
            }

            names.Sort();
            Console.WriteLine("\nNames After Sorting");
            foreach (string name in names)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(name);
            }

            names.Reverse();
            Console.WriteLine("\nNames in Descending Order");
            foreach (string name in names)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(name);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

However, when we do the same thing on a complex type like Employee, Product, Customer, Department, etc. we will get a runtime exception as “**Invalid operation exception – Failed to compare 2 elements in the array**“. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below example. Here, we are creating a collection of Employees and then calling the Sort method which will throw a runtime exception.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace ListCollectionDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            //Creating a list of type Employee
            List<Employee> listEmployees = new List<Employee>
            {
                new Employee() { ID = 101, Name = "Pranaya", Gender = "Male", Salary = 5000 },
                new Employee() { ID = 102, Name = "Priyanka", Gender = "Female", Salary = 7000 },
                new Employee() { ID = 103, Name = "Anurag", Gender = "Male", Salary = 5500 },
                new Employee() { ID = 104, Name = "Sambit", Gender = "Male", Salary = 6500 },
                new Employee() { ID = 105, Name = "Hina", Gender = "Female", Salary = 6500 }
            };

            Console.WriteLine("Employees Before Sorting");
            foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ID = {0}, Name = {1},  Gender = {2}, Salary = {3}",
                    employee.ID, employee.Name, employee.Gender, employee.Salary);
            }

            listEmployees.Sort();
            Console.WriteLine("\nEmployees After Sorting");
            foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ID = {0}, Name = {1},  Gender = {2}, Salary = {3}",
                    employee.ID, employee.Name, employee.Gender, employee.Salary);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
    public class Employee 
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Gender { get; set; }
        public int Salary { get; set; }
    }
}
```

We are getting the above Runtime Exception because at runtime the .NET Framework does not identify how to sort the complex types. In this, the .NET Runtime is unable to identify whether to sort the data based on ID property, or based on Name property, or based on Gender property, or based on Salary property, or a combination of any properties. So, if we want to sort a complex type then we need to tell the way we want the data to be sorted in the list, and to do this we need to implement the IComparable interface.

##### **How the sort functionality is working for simple data types like int, double, string, char, etc. in C#?**

This is working because these types (int, double, string, decimal, char, etc.) are already implementing the IComparable interface. If you go to the definition of any built-in types, then you will see that the class is implemented IComparable interface as shown in the below image and this is the reason why the sort functionality is working.

![How the sort functionality is working for simple data types like int, double, string, char, etc. in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221313%22%20height=%22313%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How the sort functionality is working for simple data types like int, double, string, char, etc. in C#")

##### **How to Sort a List of Complex Types in C#?**

To sort a list of complex types without using LINQ, the complex type has to implement the **IComparable** interface and needs to provide the implementation for the **CompareTo()** method as follows. The **CompareTo()** method returns an integer value and the meaning of the return value as shown below.

1. **Return value greater than ZERO** – The current instance is greater than the object being compared with.
2. **Return value less than ZERO** – The current instance is less than the object being compared with.
3. **The Return value is ZERO** – The current instance is equal to the object being compared with.

Alternatively, we can also invoke the CompareTo() method directly. The Salary property of the Employee object is int and the CompareTo() method is already implemented on the integer type that we already discussed, so we can invoke this method and return its value as shown below.

**return this.Salary.CompareTo(obj.Salary);**

##### **Implementing the IComparable interface in C# in Employee Class**

Let us understand this with an example. What we want is, we need to sort the employees based on their Salary. To do so, our Employee class should implement the **IComparable** interface and should provide an implementation for the **CompareTo()** method. This method will compare the current object (specified with this) and the object to be compared which it will get as a parameter. So, modify the Employee class as follows and the following code exactly does the same.

```
public class Employee : IComparable<Employee>
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Gender { get; set; }
    public int Salary { get; set; }
    public int CompareTo(Employee obj)
    {
        if (this.Salary > obj.Salary)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else if (this.Salary < obj.Salary)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        else
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```

The following is the complete example code.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace ListCollectionDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            //Creating a list of type Employee
            List<Employee> listEmployees = new List<Employee>
            {
                new Employee() { ID = 101, Name = "Pranaya", Gender = "Male", Salary = 5000 },
                new Employee() { ID = 102, Name = "Priyanka", Gender = "Female", Salary = 7000 },
                new Employee() { ID = 103, Name = "Anurag", Gender = "Male", Salary = 5500 },
                new Employee() { ID = 104, Name = "Sambit", Gender = "Male", Salary = 6500 },
                new Employee() { ID = 105, Name = "Hina", Gender = "Female", Salary = 6500 }
            };

            Console.WriteLine("Employees Before Sorting");
            foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ID = {0}, Name = {1},  Gender = {2}, Salary = {3}",
                    employee.ID, employee.Name, employee.Gender, employee.Salary);
            }
            
            listEmployees.Sort();
            Console.WriteLine("\nEmployees After Sorting");
            foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ID = {0}, Name = {1},  Gender = {2}, Salary = {3}",
                    employee.ID, employee.Name, employee.Gender, employee.Salary);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public class Employee : IComparable<Employee>
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Gender { get; set; }
        public int Salary { get; set; }
        public int CompareTo(Employee obj)
        {
            if (this.Salary > obj.Salary)
            {
                return 1;
            }
            else if (this.Salary < obj.Salary)
            {
                return -1;
            }
            else
            {
                return 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Now run the above code and you will get the result in ascending order based on the Employee Salary as shown in the below image.

![Implementing the IComparable interface in C# in Employee Class](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22535%22%20height=%22265%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Implementing the IComparable interface in C# in Employee Class")

If you do not prefer to use the Sort functionality provided by the Employee class, then you can provide your own implementation by implementing the **IComparer** interface. For example, if you want the employees to be sorted by **Name** instead of **Salary** then you need to follow the below two steps.

###### **Step1: Implement the IComparer interface**

Create a class implementing the **IComparer**<T> interface and provide implementation to the Compare method as follows.

```
public class SortByName : IComparer<Employee>
{
    public int Compare(Employee x, Employee y)
    {
        return x.Name.CompareTo(y.Name);
    }
}
```

###### **Step2: Use the overloaded version of the Sort method which takes the IComparer interface as a parameter:**

Pass an instance of the class that implements the IComparer interface as an argument to the Sort() method as shown below.
**SortByName sortByName = new SortByName();**
**listEmployees.Sort(sortByName);**

##### **Complete Example to use own Comparer to Sort Employee by Name:**

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace ListCollectionDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            //Creating a list of type Employee
            List<Employee> listEmployees = new List<Employee>
            {
                new Employee() { ID = 101, Name = "Pranaya", Gender = "Male", Salary = 5000 },
                new Employee() { ID = 102, Name = "Priyanka", Gender = "Female", Salary = 7000 },
                new Employee() { ID = 103, Name = "Anurag", Gender = "Male", Salary = 5500 },
                new Employee() { ID = 104, Name = "Sambit", Gender = "Male", Salary = 6500 },
                new Employee() { ID = 105, Name = "Hina", Gender = "Female", Salary = 6500 }
            };

            Console.WriteLine("Employees Before Sorting");
            foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ID = {0}, Name = {1},  Gender = {2}, Salary = {3}",
                    employee.ID, employee.Name, employee.Gender, employee.Salary);
            }

            SortByName sortByName = new SortByName();
            listEmployees.Sort(sortByName);
            Console.WriteLine("\nEmployees After Sorting");
            foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("ID = {0}, Name = {1},  Gender = {2}, Salary = {3}",
                    employee.ID, employee.Name, employee.Gender, employee.Salary);
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public class SortByName : IComparer<Employee>
    {
        public int Compare(Employee x, Employee y)
        {
            return x.Name.CompareTo(y.Name);
        }
    }

    public class Employee
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Gender { get; set; }
        public int Salary { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Sorting Collection of Complex Types using LINQ in C#:**

Using LINQ OrderBy and OrderByDescending methods we can easily sort the elements of a collection of complex types in C#. What we need to do is, we need to call the OrderBy method if we want to Sort the elements in ascending and the OrderByDescending method if we want to sort the elements in descending order. For a better understanding please have a look at the below example.

```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
namespace ListCollectionDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            //Creating a list of type Employee
            List<Employee> listEmployees = new List<Employee>
            {
                new Employee() { ID = 101, Name = "Pranaya", Gender = "Male", Salary = 5000 },
                new Employee() { ID = 102, Name = "Priyanka", Gender = "Female", Salary = 7000 },
                new Employee() { ID = 103, Name = "Anurag", Gender = "Male", Salary = 5500 },
                new Employee() { ID = 104, Name = "Sambit", Gender = "Male", Salary = 6500 },
                new Employee() { ID = 105, Name = "Hina", Gender = "Female", Salary = 6500 }
            };

            Console.WriteLine("Employees Before Sorting");
            foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"ID = {employee.ID}, Name = {employee.Name},  Gender = {employee.Gender}, Salary = {employee.Salary}");
            }

            //Sorting Employee using Linq OrderBy Method
            listEmployees = listEmployees.OrderBy(x => x.Name).ToList();
            Console.WriteLine("\nEmployees After Sorting using Linq");
            foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"ID = {employee.ID}, Name = {employee.Name},  Gender = {employee.Gender}, Salary = {employee.Salary}");
            }

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

    public class Employee
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Gender { get; set; }
        public int Salary { get; set; }
    }
}
```

`namespace UnderstandingListSorting{public class Program{public static void Main(){List listEmployees = new List(){new Employee() {ID = 101, Name = "Pranaya", Gender = "Male", Salary = 5000},new Employee() {ID = 102, Name = "Priyanka", Gender = "Female", Salary = 7000},new Employee() {ID = 103, Name = "Anurag", Gender = "Male", Salary = 4500},new Employee() {ID = 104, Name = "Sambit", Gender = "Male", Salary = 6500},new Employee() {ID = 105, Name = "Hina", Gender = "Female", Salary = 7500},new Employee() {ID = 106, Name = "Tarun", Gender = "Male", Salary = 6000}};WriteLine("Employees before sorting");foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees){WriteLine($"ID = {employee.ID}, Name = {employee.Name}, Gender = {employee.Gender}, Salary = {employee.Salary}");}SortBySalary sortBySalary = new SortBySalary();listEmployees.Sort(sortBySalary);WriteLine("Employees after sorting - by salary");foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees){WriteLine($"ID = {employee.ID}, Name = {employee.Name}, Gender = {employee.Gender}, Salary = {employee.Salary}");}SortByName sortByName = new SortByName();listEmployees.Sort(sortByName);WriteLine("Employees after sorting - by name");foreach (Employee employee in listEmployees){WriteLine($"ID = {employee.ID}, Name = {employee.Name}, Gender = {employee.Gender}, Salary = {employee.Salary}");}`

I have tried the below code worked for me !!!!

static void Main(string[] args)
{
Employee emp1 = new Employee()
{
ID = 101,
Name = “Pranaya”,
Gender = “Male”,
Salary = 5000
};
Employee emp2 = new Employee()
{
ID = 102,
Name = “Priyanka”,
Gender = “Female”,
Salary = 7000
};
Employee emp3 = new Employee()
{
ID = 103,
Name = “Anurag”,
Gender = “Male”,
Salary = 5500
};
Employee emp4 = new Employee()
{
ID = 104,
Name = “Sambit”,
Gender = “Male”,
Salary = 6500
};
Employee emp5 = new Employee()
{
ID = 105,
Name = “Hina”,
Gender = “Female”,
Salary = 7500
};
Employee emp6 = new Employee()
{
ID = 106,
Name = “Tarun”,
Gender = “Male”,
Salary = 8500
};
List firstlist = new List();
Console.WriteLine(“Using Add method to add the data to the list”);
Console.WriteLine();
firstlist.Add(emp1);
firstlist.Add(emp2);
firstlist.Add(emp3);

foreach (var item in firstlist)
{
Console.WriteLine($”Id:{item.ID}, Name:{item.Name}, Gender:{item.Gender}, Salary:{item.Salary}”);
}
Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine(“items present in the list before sorting list”);
Console.WriteLine();
firstlist.Sort();

Console.WriteLine(“The elements of the list is after Sorting is “);

foreach (var item2 in firstlist)
{
Console.WriteLine($”Id:{item2.ID}, Name:{item2.Name}, Gender:{item2.Gender}, Salary:{item2.Salary}”);
}

Console.ReadLine();

}

public class Employee:IComparable
{
public int ID { get; set; }
public string Name { get; set; }
public string Gender { get; set; }
public int Salary { get; set; }

public int CompareTo(Employee other)
{
return this.ID.CompareTo(other.ID);
}
}
