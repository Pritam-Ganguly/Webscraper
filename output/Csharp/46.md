## **Stack and Heap Memory in .NET with Examples**

In this article, I will discuss **Stack and Heap Memory in .NET Applications** with Examples. Please read our previous article discussing the [**Checked and Unchecked Keywords in C#**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/checked-and-unchecked-keyword/) with Examples. As part of this article, first, we will discuss what happens internally when we declare a variable of value types and reference types. Then, we will move forward and learn two important concepts, i.e., stack and heap memory, and talk about value types and reference types.

##### **What Happens Internally When We Declare a Variable in a .NET Application?**

When we declare a variable in a .NET application, it allocates some memory in the RAM. The memory that it allocates in RAM has three things are as follows:

1. **Name of the Variable,**
2. **The Data Type of the Variable, and**
3. **Value of the Variable.**

For a better understanding, please have a look at the following image. Here, we declare a variable of type int and assign a value 101.

![What happens internally when we declare a variable in .NET Application?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22364%22%20height=%22170%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "What happens internally when we declare a variable in .NET Application?")

The above image shows a high-level overview of what is happening in the memory. But depending on the data type (i.e., depending on the value type and reference type ), the memory may be allocated either in the stack or in the heap memory.

##### **Understanding Stack and Heap Memory in C#:**

There are two types of memory allocation for the variables we created in the .NET Application, i.e., Stack Memory and Heap Memory. Let us understand the Stack and Heap Memory with an Example. To understand Stack and Heap Memory, please have a look at the following code, and let’s understand what actually happens in the below code internally.

![Understanding Stack and Heap Memory in .NET](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22344%22%20height=%22230%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Understanding Stack and Heap Memory in .NET")

As you can see in the above image, the SomeMethod has three statements. Let’s understand statement by statement how things are executed internally.

##### **Statement 1:**

When the first statement is executed, the compiler allocates some memory in the stack. The stack memory is responsible for keeping track of the running memory needed in your application. For a better understanding, please have a look at the following image.

![Stack in .NET Application with Examples](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22488%22%20height=%22240%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Stack in .NET Application with Examples")

##### **Statement 2:**

When the second statement is executed, it stacks this memory allocation (memory allocation for variable y) on top of the first memory allocation (memory allocation for variable x). You can think about the stack as a series of plates or dishes put on top of each other. Please have a look at the following diagram for a better understanding.

![Stack memory in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22482%22%20height=%22236%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Stack memory in C#")

The Stack Memory allocation and de-allocation in .NET uses the Last In, First Out Principle. In other words, we can say that the memory allocation and de-allocation are done only at one end of the memory, i.e., the top of the stack.

##### **Statement3:**

In the 3[^rd] statement, we have created an object of SomeClass. When the 3[^rd] statement is executed, it internally creates a pointer on the stack memory, and the actual object is stored in a different memory location called Heap memory. The Heap Memory location does not track running memory. Heap is used for dynamic memory allocation. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.

![Heap Memory in .NET Application](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22624%22%20height=%22233%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Heap Memory in .NET Application")

**Note:** The reference pointers are allocated on the stack. The statement, **SomeClass cls1,** does not allocate any memory for an instance of **SomeClass.** It only allocates a variable with the name cls1 in the stack and sets its value to null. When it hits the new keyword, it allocates memory in the heap.

##### **What Happens When the Method Completes Its Execution?**

When the three statements are executed, the control will exit from the method. When it passes the end control, i.e., the end curly brace “},” it will clear all the memory variables created on the stack. It will de-allocate the memory from the stack in a ‘LIFO’ fashion. For a better understanding, please have a look at the below image.

![What happens to stack and Heap memory when the method complete its execution?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22630%22%20height=%22250%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "What happens to stack and Heap memory when the method complete its execution?")

It will not de-allocate the Heap memory. Later, the heap memory will be de-allocated by the garbage collector. Now, you may have one question in your mind: why two types of memory? Can’t we allocate everything to just one memory type?

##### **Why do we have two types of memory?**

In C#, primitive data types, such as int, double, bool, etc., hold a single value. On the other hand, the reference data types or object data types are complex, i.e., an object data type or reference data type can have reference to other objects and other primitive data types.

So, the reference data type holds references to other multiple values, and each one of them must be stored in memory. Object types need dynamic memory, while primitive data types need static memory. Please have a look at the following image for a better understanding.

![Why we have two types of memory (Stack and Heap in .NET)?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22378%22%20height=%22163%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Why we have two types of memory (Stack and Heap in .NET)?")

##### **Value Types and Reference Types in C#.NET**

As we understood the concept of Stack and Heap, Now, let us move forward and understand the concept value types and reference types in C#. The Value types are the types that hold both data and memory in the same location. On the other hand, a reference type is a type that has a pointer that points to the actual memory location.

##### **Understanding Value Type in C#:**

Let us understand value type with an example. Please have a look at the following image. As you can see in the image, first, we create an integer variable with the name x, and then we assign this x integer value to another integer variable named y. In this case, the memory allocation for these two variables will be done inside the stack memory.

![Understanding Value Type in .NET](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22367%22%20height=%22161%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Understanding Value Type in .NET")

In .NET, when we assign one integer variable value to another integer variable, it creates a completely different copy in the stack memory. That’s what you can see in the above image. So, if you change one variable value, the other variable will not be affected. In .NET, these data types are called Value types. So, bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, long, sbyte, int, short, ulong, struct, uint, ushort are examples of value types.

##### **Understanding Reference Type in C#:**

Let us understand reference type with an example. Please have a look at the following image. Here, first, we create an object, i.e., obj1) and then assign this object to another object, i.e., obj2. In this case, both reference variables (obj1 and obj2) will point to the same memory location.

![Understanding Reference Type in C#](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22600%22%20height=%22191%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Understanding Reference Type in C#")

In this case, when you change one of them, the other object is also affected. These kinds of data types are termed Reference types in .NET. So, class, interface, object, string, and delegate are examples of Reference Types.

##### **How is the Heap Memory Freed Up?**

The memory allocation on the stack is deallocated when the control moves out from the method, i.e., once the method completes its execution. On the other hand, the memory allocation, which is done on the heap, needs to be de-allocated by the garbage collector.

When an object stored on the heap is no longer used, that means the object does not have any reference pointing. Then, the object is eligible for garbage collection. The garbage collector will de-allocate this object from the heap at some point.

##### **Stack Memory Key Points:**

- **Allocation:** Stack memory is allocated for static memory allocation and local variables. It’s managed by the CPU, making it faster and more efficient.
- **Usage:** When a method is called, a block of memory (a stack frame) is allocated on the stack for its local variables and parameters. When the method call returns, the block becomes unused and can be used for the next method call.
- **Lifespan:** Variables stored in the stack are only available during the lifetime of the method call.
- **Type of Data:** It stores value types in C#. These include primitive data types (like int, double, char), structs, and references to objects (the references themselves, not the objects).

##### **Heap Memory Key Points:**

- **Allocation:** Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation, which includes objects and complex data structures that require more flexibility and are managed by the garbage collector in .NET.
- **Usage:** Objects are allocated on the heap, and memory is managed at runtime. New objects are created using the new keyword, and the garbage collector automatically frees up heap memory when objects are no longer in use.
- **Lifespan:** Objects on the heap live from when they are created until they are no longer used and are garbage collected.
- **Type of Data:** It stores reference types like objects, arrays, and class instances.

##### **Key Differences Between Stack and Head Memory in .NET:**

- **Management:** Stack memory is automatically managed by the system, whereas heap memory is dynamically allocated and deallocated by the garbage collector.
- **Speed:** Stack memory is generally faster than heap memory because of its organization and the way it’s managed.
- **Size:** The stack has size limits based on the thread, but the heap can dynamically grow as needed (limited by the system’s available memory).
- **Access:** Stack memory access is more straightforward and faster, while heap memory requires more complex management.
- **Storage:** Value types are stored in stack memory, while reference types are stored in heap memory.

Hi, thanks for nice tutorial.

I would like to add some info about value types and stack.

Value types are only stored on the stack if they are local variables inside a method, or their parameters. This is what the stack is there for: storing local variables and parameters (and the return pointers of function calls).

If the value type was declared as a variable inside a method then it’s stored on the stack.
If the value type was declared as a method parameter then it’s stored on the stack.
If the value type was declared as a member of a class then it’s stored on the heap, along with its parent.
If the value type was declared as a member of a struct then it’s stored wherever that struct is stored.
