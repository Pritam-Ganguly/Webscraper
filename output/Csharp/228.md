## **C# 7 New Features**

In this article, I am going to discuss **C# 7 New Features** with Examples. The C# 7 comes with a number of new features which bring a focus on data consumption, code simplification, and performance.

I think the biggest C# 7 new features are Tuples and Pattern Matching. Now you can return multiple different or the same type of values from a method using Tuples. Pattern Matching is the concept that is used to simplify the code that is based on the condition, creating the appropriate object. Along with these two features, there are also many other features are also introduced. In this article, we are going to discuss what are the new features introduced in C# 7. Please have a look at the following diagram.
