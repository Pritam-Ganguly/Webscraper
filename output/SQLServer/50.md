## **Row\_Number Function in SQL Server with Examples**

In this article, I am going to discuss **Row\_Number Function in SQL Server** with Examples. Please read our previous article where we discussed the [**OVER Clause in SQL Server**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/over-clause-sql-server/) before proceeding to this article. At the end of this article, you will understand what exactly the **ROW\_NUMBER** function is and when and how to use the Row Number function in SQL Server. As part of this article, I am going to discuss the following pointers.

1. **What is ROW\_NUMBER Function in SQL Server?**
2. **Understanding the importance of PARTITION BY and ORDER BY Clause in ROW\_NUMBER Function.**
3. **How to use the ROW\_NUMBER Function with and without the PARTITION BY clause?**
4. **Multiple examples to understand the Row\_Number function.**
5. **Finally, one real-time example of the ROW\_NUMBER Function.**

##### **ROW\_NUMBER Function in SQL Server:**

The Row Number function was introduced in SQL Server 2005. The ROW\_NUMBER function is basically used when you want to return a sequential number starting from 1.

The ROW\_NUMBER() is a built-in function in SQL Server that assigns a sequential integer number to each row within a partition of a result set. The row number always starts with 1 for the first row in each partition and then increases by 1 for the next row onwards in each partition. The syntax to use the ROW\_NUMBER function is given below.

![Row_Number Function in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22438%22%20height=%22223%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Row_Number Function in SQL Server")

###### **PARTITION BY value\_expression:**

This is optional. The PARTITION BY clause is used to divide the result set that is produced by the FROM clause into partitions and then the ROW\_NUMBER function is applied to each partition. Here, the value\_expression specifies the column name (s) using which the result set is going to be partitioned. As it is optional, if you did not specify the PARTITION BY clause, then the ROW\_NUMBER function will treat all the rows of the query as a single group.

##### **Order\_by\_clause:**

It is required. The ORDER BY clause is basically used to define the sequence in which each row is going to assign its unique ROW\_NUMBER.

**Note:** If you did not use the **PARTITION BY** clause with the **ROW\_NUMBER** function, then the result set will consider as a single partition.

##### **Example: Row\_Number Function in SQL Server**

Let us see some examples to understand the ROW NUMBER function in SQL Server. We are going to use the following Employee table.

![Row_Number Function in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22412%22%20height=%22353%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Row_Number Function in SQL Server")

**Please use the following SQL Script to create and populate the Employees table with the required data.**

```
CREATE TABLE Employees
(
     ID INT,
     Name VARCHAR(50),
     Department VARCHAR(50),
     Salary int
)
Go

INSERT INTO Employees Values (1, 'James', 'IT', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (2, 'Smith', 'IT', 35000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (3, 'Rasol', 'HR', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (4, 'Rakesh', 'Payroll', 35000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (5, 'Pam', 'IT', 42000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (6, 'Stokes', 'HR', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (7, 'Taylor', 'HR', 67000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (8, 'Preety', 'Payroll', 67000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (9, 'Priyanka', 'Payroll', 55000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (10, 'Anurag', 'Payroll', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (11, 'Marshal', 'HR', 55000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (12, 'David', 'IT', 96000)
```

##### **ROW\_NUMBER Function without PARTITION BY:**

Let us see an example of the ROW\_NUMBER function without using the PARTITION BY Clause. As we already discussed if we did not specify the PARTITION BY Clause, then the ROW\_NUMBER function will treat the whole result set as a single group. As a result, the ROW\_NUMBER function will provide a consecutive sequence numbering for all the rows present in the result set based on the column(s) specified in the order by clause. The following is an example of the ROW\_NUMBER function without using the PARTITION BY clause.

**SELECT Name, Department, Salary,**
**ROW\_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Department) AS RowNumber**
**FROM Employees**

Once you execute the above query, you will get the below output. As you can see in the below output, there will be no partition and hence all the rows are assigned with consecutive sequence numbering starting from 1 to 12.

![ROW_NUMBER Function without PARTITION BY](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22699%22%20height=%22475%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "ROW_NUMBER Function without PARTITION BY")

**Note:** If you did not specify the ORDER BY clause then you will get the error stating **“The function ‘ROW\_NUMBER’ must have an OVER clause with ORDER BY”**.

##### **Row\_Number Function with PARTITION BY Clause:**

Let us see an example of the ROW\_NUMBER function using the PARTITION BY Clause. When you specify the PARTITION BY Clause, then the data is partitioned based on the column you specify in the Partition BY clause. Please have a look at the following image to understand this better. As you can see we have specified Department in the Partition By clause and Name in the Order By clause.

In our example, we have three departments. So, the Partition By Clause will divide all the rows into three partitions or you can say three groups. Then in each group or in each partition, the data is sorted based on the Name column. The ROW\_NUMBER function then gives a unique sequence to each partition starting from 1. As we have three partitions, each partition will start from 1 that which you can see in the below image.

![Row_Number Function with PARTITION BY Clause](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22776%22%20height=%22651%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Row_Number Function with PARTITION BY Clause")

**Now execute the following code and you will get the output as we discussed in the previous image.**

```
SELECT Name, Department, Salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER 
       (
            PARTITION BY Department
            ORDER BY Name
       ) AS RowNumber
FROM Employees
```

**Note:** When the partition changes the row number is reset to 1. So, basically whenever you want to give a unique number on the fly to the rows in the result set, then you need to use the ROW\_NUMBER function.

##### **Real-time Example of ROW\_NUMBER function in SQL Server:**

Let us see one real-time example of the ROW\_NUMER function in SQL Server. To understand this first delete all the records which are there in the Employees table by executing the following SQL query.

**TRUNCATE TABLE Employees**

Once you delete all the data from the Employees table then please insert the following records into the Employees table.

```
INSERT INTO Employees Values (1, 'James', 'IT', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (1, 'James', 'IT', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (2, 'Rasol', 'HR', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (2, 'Rasol', 'HR', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (2, 'Rasol', 'HR', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (3, 'Stokes', 'HR', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (3, 'Stokes', 'HR', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (3, 'Stokes', 'HR', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (3, 'Stokes', 'HR', 15000)
```

Now, intentionally we have inserted some duplicate data into the Employees table as shown below.

![Real-time Example of ROW_NUMBER function in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22417%22%20height=%22282%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Real-time Example of ROW_NUMBER function in SQL Server")

Now we need to delete the duplicate records from the Employees table. Once you delete the duplicate data, then your table should have the following record.

![Real-time Example of ROW_NUMBER in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22419%22%20height=%22124%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Real-time Example of ROW_NUMBER in SQL Server")

The following SQL query will delete the duplicate records from the Employees table. Here, the PARTITION BY clause divides the query result set into partitions based on the ID values. That means it will create multiple partitions based on the ID values and give sequential integer numbers starting from 1 for each partition. Then here the DELETE statements will delete the records from each partition where the RowNumber is greater than 1. It means it will keep only one record from each partition and delete the rest of all.

**WITH DeleteDuplicateCTE AS**
**(**
     **SELECT \*, ROW\_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ID ORDER BY ID) AS RowNumber**
     **FROM Employees**
**)**
**DELETE FROM DeleteDuplicateCTE WHERE RowNumber > 1**

Once you execute the above SQL query, now verify the Employees table and you can see the duplicates records are deleted. So, in short, the ROW\_NUMBER function Returns an increasing unique number for each row starting from 1, even if there are duplicates.

In the next article, I am going to discuss the [**RANK and DENSE\_RANK function in SQL Server**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/rank-dense_rank-function-sql-server/)with examples. Here, in this article, I try to explain the **ROW\_NUMBER Function in SQL Server** with Examples. I hope now you understand the need and use of the ROW\_NUMBER function in SQL Server with Examples.
