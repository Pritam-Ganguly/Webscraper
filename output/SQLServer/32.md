## **INTERSECT** **Operator in SQL Server with Examples**

In this article, I am going to discuss the **INTERSECT Operator in SQL Server** with Examples. The INTERSECT operator belongs to the SET Operator category. Please read our previous articles where we discussed the basics of [**SET Operators in SQL Server**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/union-and-union-all-operators-sql-server/) as well as we also discussed the [**UNION and UNION ALL SET Operators**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/union-and-union-all-operators-sql-server/) in detail.

##### **What is the INTERSECT operator in SQL Server?**

The INTERSECT operator in SQL Server is used to retrieve the common records of both the left and the right query of the Intersect operator. If this is not clear at the moment then don’t worry we will try to understand this with some examples.

##### **Understanding the INTERSECT operator with examples.**

Let us understand the INTERSECT Operator in SQL Server with some examples. We are going to use the following “**EmployeeIndia**” and “**EmployeeUK**” tables to understand INTERSECT SET operator.

![UNION and UNION ALL Operators in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22581%22%20height=%22203%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "UNION and UNION ALL Operators in SQL Server")

**Please use the below SQL Script to create Database EmployeeDB, tables EmployeeIndia, and EmployeeUK and populate these two tables with the required test data.**

```
CREATE DATABASE EmployeeDB
GO

USE EmployeeDB
GO

CREATE TABLE EmployeeIndia
(
  ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Gender VARCHAR(10),
  Department VARCHAR(50)
)
GO

INSERT INTO EmployeeIndia VALUES(1, 'Pranaya', 'Male','IT')
INSERT INTO EmployeeIndia VALUES(2, 'Priyanka', 'Female','IT')
INSERT INTO EmployeeIndia VALUES(3, 'Preety', 'Female','HR')
INSERT INTO EmployeeIndia VALUES(4, 'Subrat', 'Male','HR')
INSERT INTO EmployeeIndia VALUES(5, 'Anurag', 'Male','IT')
GO

CREATE TABLE EmployeeUK
(
  ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Gender VARCHAR(10),
  Department VARCHAR(50)
)
GO

INSERT INTO EmployeeUK VALUES(1, 'James', 'Male','IT')
INSERT INTO EmployeeUK VALUES(2, 'Priyanka', 'Female','IT')
INSERT INTO EmployeeUK VALUES(3, 'Sara', 'Female','HR')
INSERT INTO EmployeeUK VALUES(4, 'Subrat', 'Male','HR')
INSERT INTO EmployeeUK VALUES(5, 'Pam', 'Female','HR')
GO
```

###### **Example:**

The following query retrieves the common records from both the left and the right query of the Intersect operator. 

**SELECT ID, Name, Gender, Department FROM TableA**
**INTERSECT**
**SELECT ID, Name, Gender, Department FROM TableB**

###### **Result:**

![Intersect operator in SQL server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22217%22%20height=%2268%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Intersect operator in SQL server")

We can also achieve the same thing using the INNER join. The following INNER join query would produce the exact same result. 

**Select TableA.ID, TableA.Name, TableA.Gender, TableA.Department**
**From TableA Inner Join TableB**
**On TableA.ID = TableB.ID**

###### **Result:**

##### **What is the difference between INTERSECT and INNER JOIN in SQL Server?**

The INTERSECT Operator filters duplicate rows and return only the DISTINCT rows that are common between the LEFT and Right Query, whereas INNER JOIN does not filter the duplicates. To understand this difference, insert the following row into TableA

**INSERT INTO TableA VALUES(2, ‘Priyanka’, ‘Female’,’IT’)**

Now execute the following INTERSECT query. Notice that we get only the DISTINCT rows in the output.

**SELECT ID, Name, Gender, Department FROM TableA**
**INTERSECT**
**SELECT ID, Name, Gender, Department FROM TableB**

###### **Result:**

Now execute the following INNER JOIN query. Notice that the duplicate rows are not filtered.

**Select TableA.ID, TableA.Name, TableA.Gender, TableA.Department**
**From TableA Inner Join TableB**
**On TableA.ID = TableB.ID**

###### **Result:**

![Intersect operator in SQL server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22216%22%20height=%2286%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Intersect operator in SQL server")

We can make the INNER JOIN behave like INTERSECT operator by using the DISTINCT operator 

**Select DISTINCT TableA.ID, TableA.Name, TableA.Gender, TableA.Department**
**From TableA Inner Join TableB**
**On TableA.ID = TableB.ID**

###### **Result:**

![INNER JOIN Using DISTINCT Operatpr in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22216%22%20height=%2268%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "INNER JOIN Using DISTINCT Operatpr in SQL Server")

INNER JOIN treats two NULLS as two different values. So if you are joining two tables based on a nullable column and if both tables have NULLs in that joining column then, INNER JOIN will not include those rows in the result-set, whereas INTERSECT treats two NULLs as the same value and it returns all matching rows.

###### **To understand this difference, execute the following 2 insert statements**

**INSERT INTO TableA VALUES(NULL, ‘Pam’, ‘Female’, ‘HR’)**
**INSERT INTO TableB VALUES(NULL,’Pam’, ‘Female’, ‘HR’)**

###### **Example: Using the INTERSECT query**

**SELECT ID, Name, Gender, Department FROM TableA**
**INTERSECT**
**SELECT ID, Name, Gender, Department FROM TableB**

**Result:**

##### **Example: Using INNER JOIN query**

**Select TableA.ID, TableA.Name, TableA.Gender, TableA.Department**
**From TableA Inner Join TableB**
**On TableA.ID = TableB.ID**

###### **Result:**

In the above example the common employees are ‘Priyanka’ and ‘Subrat’ while in output it is returning ‘Priyanka’ and ‘Preety’

Great tutorial, thanks.

INTERSECT AND INNER JOIN can not give the same results because in INTERSECT the comparison is based on the equality of all columns whereas in INNER JOIN it is based on one column (i.e ID).
Let’s see the following example:-

INSERT INTO TableA
SELECT 1, ‘Pranaya’, ‘Male’,’IT’ UNION
SELECT 2, ‘Priyanka’, ‘Female’,’IT’ UNION
SELECT 3, ‘Preety’, ‘Female’,’HR’

INSERT INTO TableB
SELECT 1, ‘Balu’, ‘Male’,’HR’ UNION
SELECT 2, ‘Priyanka’, ‘Female’,’IT’ UNION
SELECT 3, ‘Preety’, ‘Female’,’HR’

Query 1 – Using INTERSECT
SELECT ID, Name, Gender, Department FROM TableA
INTERSECT
SELECT ID, Name, Gender, Department FROM TableB

Result:-
ID Name Gender Department
2 Priyanka Female IT
3 Preety Female HR

Query 2 – Using INNER JOIN
Select TableA.ID, TableA.Name, TableA.Gender, TableA.Department
From TableA Inner Join TableB
On TableA.ID = TableB.ID

Result:-
ID Name Gender Department
1 Pranaya Male IT
2 Priyanka Female IT
3 Preety Female HR

As we can see the results are different INNER JOIN just checks only based on ID whereas INTERSECT compares the value of each column. The was the same problem incase of EXCEPT and NOT IN.

Thank you!
