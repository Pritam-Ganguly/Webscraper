## **Triggers Execution Order in SQL Server with Examples**

In this article, I am going to discuss the Triggers Execution Order in SQL Server with Examples. Please read our previous article where we discussed [**DDL Triggers in SQL Server**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/ddl-triggers-in-sql-server/) with examples. At the end of this article, you will understand how to set the execution order of triggers using the **sp\_settriggerorder** system stored procedure. 

**Note:** The Server-Scoped Triggers in SQL Server are always fired before any of the databases scoped triggers and we cannot change this execution order.

##### **Example to understand Triggers Execution Order in SQL Server:**

Let’s create two DDL Triggers with one database Scoped and one Server-Scoped. We need to create the Database Scoped Trigger in a specific database.

```
CREATE TRIGGER tr_DatabaseScopeDDLTrigger
ON DATABASE
FOR CREATE_TABLE
AS
BEGIN
    Print 'Database Scope DDL Trigger'
END
GO

CREATE TRIGGER tr_ServerScopeDDLTrigger
ON ALL SERVER
FOR CREATE_TABLE
AS
BEGIN
    Print 'Server Scope DDL Trigger'
END
GO
```

Here we have created one database-scoped (tr\_DatabaseScopeDDLTrigger) and one server-scoped (tr\_ServerScopeDDLTrigger) DDL trigger and both the triggers handling the same DDL event i.e. CREATE\_TABLE.

##### **Let’s create a table and see what happens**

**CREATE TABLE Employee(ID INT, Name VARCHAR(100))**

**When we execute the above create statement it will give us the below output.**

![Triggers Execution Order in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22238%22%20height=%2252%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Triggers Execution Order in SQL Server")

So, from the above output, it proofs that the Server-Scoped DDL Trigger is always fired before the Database-Scoped DDL Trigger is fired in SQL Server. 

We can use the **sp\_settriggerorder** system stored procedure to set the execution order of Server-Scoped or Database-Scoped DDL triggers in SQL Server. 

The **sp\_settriggerorder** system stored procedure has 4 parameters 

1. **@triggername:** The Name of the Trigger
2. **@order:** The order value can be First, Last, or None. When we set to None, the trigger is fired in random order
3. **@stmttype:** The SQL statement that fires the trigger and the value can be INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or any DDL event
4. **@namespace:** The namespace determines the Scope of the trigger and the value can be DATABASE, SERVER, or NULL

###### **To understand the execution order, Let’s create another database scoped DDL Trigger as shown below**

```
CREATE TRIGGER tr_DatabaseScopeDDLTrigger
ON DATABASE
FOR CREATE_TABLE
AS
BEGIN
    Print 'Database Scope DDL Trigger'
END
GO
```

**Now set the Execution order using the sp\_settriggerorder system stored procedure as shown below.**

```
EXEC	sp_settriggerorder
  @triggername = 'tr_DatabaseScopeDDLTrigger1',
  @order = 'FIRST',
  @stmttype = 'CREATE_TABLE',
  @namespace = 'DATABASE'
GO
```

**Now create a table and see the order**

**CREATE TABLE Employee1(ID INT, Name VARCHAR(100))**

**When we execute the above create table statement, it will give us the below output.**

![Triggers Execution Order in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22246%22%20height=%2273%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Triggers Execution Order in SQL Server")

If we have both a database-scoped and a server-scoped DDL trigger handling the same event and if we have to set the execution order at both levels. Here is the execution order of the triggers.

1. The server-scope trigger set as First
2. Then other server-scope triggers
3. Next, the server-scope trigger set as Last
4. The database-scope trigger set as First
5. Then other database-scope triggers
6. The database-scope trigger set as Last

In the next article, I am going to discuss [**Creating and Managing Users in SQL Server**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/creating-and-managing-users-in-sql-server/) with examples. Here, in this article, I try to explain the **Triggers Execution Order in SQL Server** step by step with an example. I hope this article will help you with your need.

The tr\_DatabaseScopeDDLTrigger1 example in article is error.
