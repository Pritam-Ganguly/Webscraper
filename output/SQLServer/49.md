# OVER Clause in SQL Server

## **OVER Clause in SQL Server with Examples**

In this article, I am going to discuss the **OVER Clause in SQL Server** with examples. Please read our previous article where we discussed the [**built-in string function**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/built-in-string-functions-in-sql-server/) in SQL Server. At the end of this article, you will understand the power and use of the OVER Clause in SQL Server with Examples.

##### **OVER Clause in SQL Server:**

The OVER clause in SQL Server is used with PARTITION BY to break up the data into partitions. Following is the syntax of the OVER clause.

![OVER Clause in SQL Server:](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22378%22%20height=%22103%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "OVER Clause in SQL Server:")

The specified function is going to operate for each partition. See the following example. Let say we have three departments (HR, IT, Payroll).

**COUNT (Department) OVER (PARTITION BY Department)** 

In the above example, the data will be partition by Department i.e. there will be three partitions (IT, HR, and Payroll), and then the COUNT() function will be applied to each partition. Here, you can use a wide range of built-in functions such as COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), ROW\_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE\_RANK(), AVG(), MIN(), etc.

##### **Example: OVER clause in SQL Server**

Let us see an example, to understand the use of the SQL Server Over clause. We are going to use the following Employee table.

![OVER clause Example in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22412%22%20height=%22353%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "OVER clause Example in SQL Server")

**Please use the following SQL Script to create and populate the Employees table with the required data.**

```
CREATE TABLE Employees
(
     ID INT,
     Name VARCHAR(50),
     Department VARCHAR(50),
     Salary int
)
Go

INSERT INTO Employees Values (1, 'James', 'IT', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (2, 'Smith', 'IT', 35000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (3, 'Rasol', 'HR', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (4, 'Rakesh', 'Payroll', 35000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (5, 'Pam', 'IT', 42000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (6, 'Stokes', 'HR', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (7, 'Taylor', 'HR', 67000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (8, 'Preety', 'Payroll', 67000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (9, 'Priyanka', 'Payroll', 55000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (10, 'Anurag', 'Payroll', 15000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (11, 'Marshal', 'HR', 55000)
INSERT INTO Employees Values (12, 'David', 'IT', 96000)
```

##### **Example:**

We need to generate a report to display the total number of employees department-wise. Along with this we also need to display the Total Salary, Average Salary, Minimum Salary, and Maximum Salary department wise. That means we need to generate a report like below.

![How to use Over Clause in SQL Server?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22761%22%20height=%22138%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to use Over Clause in SQL Server?")

We can easily achieve the above data simply by using the GROUP BY clause in SQL Server. The following SQL Query will give you the desired output.

```
SELECT  Department, 
 COUNT(*) AS NoOfEmployees, 
 SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary,
 AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary,
 MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary, 
 MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
```

##### **Example:**

Now the business requirement changes, now we also need to show the non-aggregated values (Name and Salary) in the report along with the aggregated values as shown in the below image.

![OVER Clause with PARTITION BY Clause](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22947%22%20height=%22408%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "OVER Clause with PARTITION BY Clause")

You may be intended to use the following SQL query by adding the Salary, Name column in the select clause. But this is not going to be work.

```
SELECT  Name, Salary, Department, 
 COUNT(*) AS NoOfEmployees, 
 SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary,
 AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary,
 MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary, 
 MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
```

When you execute the above query, you will get the following error. This is because it is not possible to include the non-aggregated column in the select list when you are using a group by clause in SQL Server.

![GROUP BY Clause in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22897%22%20height=%2277%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "GROUP BY Clause in SQL Server")

##### **How can we achieve the desired output?**

We can get the desired output in two ways.

###### **Solution1:**

One of the ways to get the desired output is by including all the aggregations in a subquery and then JOINING that subquery with the main query. The following example exactly does the same.

```
SELECT	Name, Salary, Employees.Department, 
  Departments.DepartmentTotals,
  Departments.TotalSalary, 
  Departments.AvgSalary, 
  Departments.MinSalary, 
  Departments.MaxSalary   
FROM		Employees
INNER JOIN
(	SELECT	Department, COUNT(*) AS DepartmentTotals,
  SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary,
  AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary,
  MIN(Salary) AS MinSalary, 
  MAX(Salary) AS MaxSalary
 FROM Employees
 GROUP BY Department) AS Departments
ON Departments.Department = Employees.Department
```

Once you execute the above query then you will get the desired output. But look at the number of T-SQL statements that we wrote.

###### **Solution2:**

The second way that is the most preferable way to get the desired output is by using the OVER clause combined with the **PARTITION BY** clause as shown in the below code.

```
SELECT  Name, 
 Salary, 
 Department,
 COUNT(Department) OVER(PARTITION BY Department) AS DepartmentTotals,
 SUM(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department) AS TotalSalary,
 AVG(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department) AS AvgSalary,
 MIN(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department) AS MinSalary,
 MAX(Salary) OVER(PARTITION BY Department) AS MaxSalary
FROM Employees
```

Once you execute the above code, you will get the output as expected.

In the next article, I am going to discuss the [**ROW\_NUMBER function in SQL Server**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/row_number-function-sql-server/) with examples. Here, in this article, I try to explain the need and use of the **OVER Clause in SQL Server**. I hope you enjoy this OVER Clause in SQL Server with Examples article.

What about Order By cluse and Rows or Range clause ?
Could you please provide examples for above clause?
