## **Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Functions in SQL Server**

In this article, I am going to discuss **Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Functions in SQL Server** with Examples. Please read our previous article where we discussed [**Encryption and Schema Binding Option in SQL Server**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/encryption-and-schema-binding-option-in-sql-server-functions/). At the end of this article, you will understand what are Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Functions in SQL Server.

##### **Example: Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Functions in SQL Server**

We are going to use the following Employee table to understand Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Functions in SQL Server.

![Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Functions in SQL Server](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22428%22%20height=%22170%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Functions in SQL Server")

**Please use the below script to create and populate the Employee table with sample data.**

```
-- Create Employee Table
CREATE TABLE Employee
(
  ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(50),
  Gender VARCHAR(50),
  DOB DATETIME,
  DeptID INT
)
GO

-- Populate the Employee Table with test data
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES(1, 'Pranaya', 'Male','1996-02-29 10:53:27.060', 1)
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES(2, 'Priyanka', 'Female','1995-05-25 10:53:27.060', 2)
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES(3, 'Anurag', 'Male','1995-04-19 10:53:27.060', 2)
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES(4, 'Preety', 'Female','1996-03-17 10:53:27.060', 3)
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES(5, 'Sambit', 'Male','1997-01-15 10:53:27.060', 1)
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES(6, 'Hina', 'Female','1995-07-12 10:53:27.060', 2)
GO
```

##### **Deterministic Functions in SQL server**

The Deterministic functions in SQL Server always return the same result every time they are called with a specific set of input values and give the same state of the database. For examples: **SQUARE(), Power(), Sum(), AVG(), and Count().** All aggregate functions are deterministic functions. Let us see some examples.

**Example1: SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM Employee**
Every time we execute the above statement it will give 6

**Example2: SELECT SQUARE(3)**
Every time we execute the above statement it will give 9

##### **Non-Deterministic Functions in SQL Server**

The Non-deterministic functions in SQL Server may return different results each time they are called with a specific set of values even if the database state that they access remains the same. For examples: **GetDate()** and **Current\_Timestamp**

**Example1: SELECT GetDate()**
Every time we execute the above SQL Query, it will give a different result

**Example2: SELECT Current\_timestamp**
Every time the results will vary, it will return the date and time of the SQL Server

The RAND() function is a Non-Deterministic function but if we provide the seed value the function becomes deterministic as the same value gets returned for the same seed value.

**Example1: SELECT Rand(1)**
Deterministic as it returns the same value every time

**Example2: SELECT Rand()**
Non-deterministic as the returned values change every time

In the next article, I am going to discuss [**Transaction Management in SQL Server**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/transaction-management-in-sql-server/) with Examples. Here, in this article, I try to explain the **Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Functions in SQL Server** with Examples. I hope this article will help you with your need. I would like to have your feedback. Please post your feedback, question, or comments about this article.
