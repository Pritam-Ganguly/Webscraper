        // Constructor accepting DbContextOptions
        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options)
        {
        }

        // Configuring model properties and relationships
        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

            // Order -> BillingAddress 
            modelBuilder.Entity<Order>()

#### **Creating DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**

The DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) folder contains classes that facilitate controlled data exchange between the client and server, ensuring that only necessary data is exposed or accepted. So, create a folder named **DTOs** at the project root directory and add the following classes. Once you create the DTOs folder, then please add the following DTOs.

##### **Define a Standardized Response Type (ApiResponse<T>)**

Creating a standardized response type ensures that all API responses follow a consistent structure. This makes it easier for clients to parse responses and handle errors uniformly. So, create a new class file named **ApiResponse.cs** within the DTOs folder and copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace ECommerceApp.DTOs
{
    // Standardized API response structure.
    // T represents then Type of the response data
    public class ApiResponse<T>
    {
        // HTTP status code of the response.
        public int StatusCode { get; set; }

        // Indicates whether the request was successful.
        public bool Success { get; set; }

        // Response data in case successful
        public T Data { get; set; }

        // List of error messages, if any.
        public List<string> Errors { get; set; }

        public ApiResponse()
        {
            Success = true;
            Errors = new List<string>();
        }

        public ApiResponse(int statusCode, T data)
        {
            StatusCode = statusCode;
            Success = true;
            Data = data;
            Errors = new List<string>();
        }

        public ApiResponse(int statusCode, List<string> errors)
        {
            StatusCode = statusCode;
            Success = false;
            Errors = errors;
        }

        public ApiResponse(int statusCode, string error)
        {
            StatusCode = statusCode;
            Success = false;
            Errors = new List<string> { error };
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Key Features:**

This DTO defines a standardized API response structure to ensure consistency across all API responses, facilitating easier client-side parsing and error handling.

- Generic class with properties like StatusCode, Success, Data, and Errors.
- Constructors to handle different response scenarios (success with data, failure with errors).

#### **ConfirmationResponseDTO**

Create a class file named **ConfirmationResponseDTO.cs** within the DTOs folder and then copy and paste the following code. This DTO is a simple confirmation message structure for actions like updates and deletions.

```
namespace ECommerceApp.DTOs
{
    public class ConfirmationResponseDTO
    {
        public string Message { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Configuring the Database Connection**

In appsettings.json, configure the connection string to your SQL Server instance. So, please modify the **appsettings.json** file as follows:

```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "EFCoreDBConnection": "Server=LAPTOP-6P5NK25R\\SQLSERVER2022DEV;Database=ECommerceDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
  }
}
```

##### **Registering Services in Program.cs**

The Program.cs file is the entry point of the ASP.NET Core application. It configures services, middleware, and the HTTP request pipeline. It sets up the application by configuring services, including controllers, Swagger for API documentation, Entity Framework Core with SQL Server, and middleware components like HTTPS redirection and authorization. So, please modify the Program class as follows:

```
using ECommerceApp.Data;
using ECommerceApp.Services;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace ECommerceApp
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            // Add services to the container.

            builder.Services.AddControllers()
            .AddJsonOptions(options =>
            {
                // This will use the property names as defined in the C# model
                options.JsonSerializerOptions.PropertyNamingPolicy = null;
            });

            // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle
            builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
            builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

            // Configure EF Core with SQL Server
            builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
                options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("EFCoreDBConnection")));

            var app = builder.Build();

            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.MapControllers();

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Apply Migrations and Create the Database**

Open the Package Manager Console and then execute the following **Add-Migration** and **Update-Database** commands:

![Real-time Ecommerce Application using ASP.NET Core Web API and EF Core](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22685%22%20height=%22267%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Real-time Ecommerce Application using ASP.NET Core Web API and EF Core")

This will generate a Migrations folder and create the **ECommerceDB** in SQL Server with the required tables shown in the image below.

![Ecommerce Application using ASP.NET Core Web API](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22355%22%20height=%22570%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Ecommerce Application using ASP.NET Core Web API")

In the next article, I will discuss How to Implement the [**Customer Module in our ECommerce Application**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/customer-module-in-ecommerce-application/). In this article, we have designed our ECommerce Application database using EF Core Code First Approach and ASP.NET Core Web API. I hope you enjoy this article on how to develop a Real-Time ECommerce Application Development using ASP.NET Core Web API and EF Core. Please give your valuable feedback in the comment section.

Great application, Mr. Pranaya explained every single step in the application/project, not only the technical side, but went over the business logic and how the application should work in real life, the approach was simple separate the objects for each other and have a project structure that separate getting the data and what data to expose. Mr. Pranaya is doing a great job working on details and take the time to answer questions and then quiz the attendance by asking questions.
Thank you for your time and hard work
