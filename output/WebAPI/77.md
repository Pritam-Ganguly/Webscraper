Back to: [ASP.NET Core Web API Tutorials](https://dotnettutorials.net/course/asp-net-core-web-api-tutorials/)

## **Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API**

In this article, I will discuss How to Implement **Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API** Applications with Examples. Please read our previous articles discussing How to Implement [**NCache in ASP.NET Core Web API**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/how-to-implement-ncache-in-asp-net-core-web-api/) Applications.

#### **What is Response Caching?**

Response Caching is a mechanism used to store the responses of HTTP requests, allowing subsequent requests for the same resource to be served from the cache without reprocessing them. In ASP.NET Core Web API, Response Caching allows the server to serve cached responses for repeated client requests, reducing server load, improving response times, and enhancing overall application performance.

- **Server Load:** The server processes fewer requests.
- **Response Time:** Clients receive responses faster.
- **Database Queries:** Cached responses eliminate repetitive database calls.

Unlike in-memory caching, Response Caching is a client-side or proxy-side caching mechanism, meaning the cache is stored on the client or a proxy server, not on the Web Server itself.

##### **Understanding Client and Proxy Caching**

To understand Response Caching better, let’s first look at client-side and proxy caching:

###### **Client-Side Caching**

Client-side caching refers to storing responses on the client’s device, such as a browser or a mobile app. The client uses cache-related headers like Cache-Control to determine how and when to cache responses locally. Enables faster local access to resources.

###### **Proxy-Server Caching**

Proxy caching involves storing responses on intermediate servers (proxies) between the client and the origin server. This can include corporate proxies, CDN edge servers, or caching services like Squid. Proxy caching helps serve cached responses without contacting the origin server, improving response times for end users. It reduces the round-trip to the origin server, which is useful in distributed architectures for improving scalability.

#### **How Does Response Caching Work in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

The following diagram explains how response caching works in the ASP.NET Core Web API Application.

![How Does Response Caching Work in ASP.NET Core Web API?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221016%22%20height=%22552%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How Does Response Caching Work in ASP.NET Core Web API?")

Below is a detailed explanation of how response caching works with a typical client-proxy-server architecture:

##### **First Request**

- **Client Request:** A client (e.g., a browser or mobile app) sends a request for a resource, which is routed through a proxy server.
- **Forwarding to Web Server:** Since this is the first request, the proxy server forwards the request to the web server.
- **Caching the Response:** The web server processes the request, generates a response, and includes a Cache-Control header instructing the proxy server and client to cache the response.
- **Returning the Response:** The proxy server caches the response, and then it returns the response to the client.

##### **Subsequent Request**

- **Client Re-Request:** When the client sends the same request again, the proxy server intercepts the request.
- **Serving Cached Response:** Instead of forwarding the request to the web server, the proxy server serves the cached response directly.
- **Faster Response:** This reduces server load and significantly improves response time.

##### **How Do We Use Response Caching in ASP.NET Core?**

To implement response caching in an ASP.NET Core Web API, we need:

- Enable **Response Caching Services** and **Middleware Component** in Program.cs class file.
- Apply **ResponseCache** attributes to relevant action methods or controllers with the required settings.

##### **Implementing Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API:**

Imagine we have an e-commerce application and need an endpoint that returns a list of products. These products are stored in an SQL Server database, and we use the Entity Framework Core Code First Approach to interact with the database.

To optimize performance, we will implement response caching so that repeated requests for the same product data are served from the cache instead of hitting the application server and database every time. We will cache the response for a few minutes to avoid unnecessary database queries.

Let’s proceed to understand how to implement response caching in an ASP.NET Core Web API application that interacts with a SQL Server database using the Entity Framework Core Code First Approach.

##### **Create the Project and Install Packages**

First, create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project with the name **ResponseCachingDemo** and then install the Following Packages, which are required for Entity Framework core to interact with the SQL Server database and manage database migration.

- **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer**
- **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools**

You can install the above two packages using NuGet Package Manager Solutions or the Package Manager Console. To do so, open the Package Manager console and execute the following commands.

- **Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer**
- **Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools**

##### **Create the Data Model and DbContext**

First, create a folder named **Models** in the project root directory. This is where we will create our Models and DbContext classes.

##### **Create the Product Model:**

Add a new class file named **Product.cs** within the Models folder and then copy and paste the following code.

```
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;
namespace ResponseCachingDemo.Models
{
    public class Product
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string? Description { get; set; }
        [Column(TypeName ="decimal(8,2)")]
        public decimal Price { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Create the DbContext:**

Next, add a class file named **ApplicationDbContext.cs** within the Models folder and copy and paste the following code. Here, we are also adding some seed data for testing purposes.

```
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
namespace ResponseCachingDemo.Models
{
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options)
            : base(options)
        {
        }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

            // Seed data
            modelBuilder.Entity<Product>().HasData(
                new Product { Id = 1, Name = "Product A", Price = 10.0M, Description = "Product A Description" },
                new Product { Id = 2, Name = "Product B", Price = 20.0M, Description = "Product B Description" },
                new Product { Id = 3, Name = "Product C", Price = 30.0M, Description = "Product C Description" },
                new Product { Id = 4, Name = "Product D", Price = 40.0M, Description = "Product D Description" },
                new Product { Id = 5, Name = "Product E", Price = 50.0M, Description = "Product E Description" }
            );
        }

        public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Configure the connection string in appsettings.json:**

Next, we need to include the connection string in the appsettings.json file. So, please modify the appsettings.json file as follows:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=LAPTOP-6P5NK25R\\SQLSERVER2022DEV;Database=ProductsDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

##### **Register the DbContext and Response Caching in the Program.cs**

Please modify the Program.cs class file as follows to register the DbContext and Response caching:

```
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using ResponseCachingDemo.Models;
namespace ResponseCachingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            // Add services to the container.
            
            // Configure DbContext with SQL Server
            builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
                options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

            // Register Response Caching services
            builder.Services.AddResponseCaching();

            builder.Services.AddControllers();
            // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle
            builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
            builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

            var app = builder.Build();

            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            // Enable Response Caching Middleware
            app.UseResponseCaching();

            app.MapControllers();

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Explanation**

- **builder.Services.AddResponseCaching():** Registers the Response Caching service to enable response caching in ASP.NET Core Web API.
- **app.UseResponseCaching():** Adds the Response Caching middleware to handle caching logic for HTTP requests and responses.

##### **Generate and Apply Database Migration:**

Open the Package Manager Console and execute the **Add-Migration** command to create a new Migration file. Then, execute the **Update-Database** command to apply the migration and update and sync the database with our models, as follows.

![Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API Applications with Examples](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22852%22%20height=%22277%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API Applications with Examples")

Once you execute the above command, it should create the **ProductsDB** database with the Products table, as shown in the below image:

![Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API Applications with Examples](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22362%22%20height=%22328%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API Applications with Examples")

Now, if you verify the Products table, then you will also see the seed data as shown in the below image:

![Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API Applications with Examples](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22447%22%20height=%22302%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API Applications with Examples")

##### **How Do We Use Response Caching Attribute in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

To implement Response Caching in ASP.NET Core, we need to use the ResponseCacheAttribute. This attribute allows us to control how responses from ASP.NET Core Web API Applications are cached. It can be applied to controller actions or entire controllers. The ResponseCache Attribute itself does not cache content. Instead, it sets the appropriate HTTP Caching headers that control the caching behavior. The ResponseCache Attribute has the following properties:

###### **Duration (int):**

This property specifies the time, in seconds, for which the response should be cached. It sets the max-age directive of the Cache-Control header. It determines how long the response is considered fresh.

###### **Location (ResponseCacheLocation Enum):**

This property determines where the response can be cached. Options include Any, Client, and None:

- **Any**: The response can be cached by both client and proxy servers. This is also the default behavior of Response caching.
- **Client**: The response is cached only on the client side.
- **None**: The response is not cached by any cache.

It is used to control the scope of caching, enhancing data privacy and control.

###### **NoStore (bool):**

This property indicates whether the response should be stored in any cache. When set to true, add **the Cache-Control: no-store** header to prevent caching. It takes precedence over other properties and ensures sensitive data is never cached.

###### **VaryByHeader (string):**

This property specifies a header name to vary the cached response. It adds the Vary header to the response, instructing caches to store separate responses based on the specified header. It is useful when responses differ based on certain request headers, such as User-Agent.

###### **VaryByQueryKeys (string[]):**

This property allows the response cache to vary based on query string parameters. So, different cache entries are created for different values of the specified query keys. This enables the caching of different responses for different query parameters.

Let us understand all the above Response Caching settings with a few examples.

##### **Create the Products Controller**

So, create an Empty API Controller named **ProductsController** within the Controllers folder and copy and paste the following code. The following code is self-explained, so please read the comment lines for a better understanding.

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using ResponseCachingDemo.Models;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace ResponseCachingDemo.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

        public ProductsController(ApplicationDbContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }

        // GET: api/Products
        // Caching All Products
        // The response will be cached for 60 seconds.
        // All requests to this endpoint will share the same cached response.
        [ResponseCache(Duration = 60)]
        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<ActionResult<List<Product>>> GetProducts()
        {
            // Retrieve all products from the database
            var products = await _context.Products.ToListAsync();

            // To show you the performance differences we delay the response for 3 seconds
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));

            return Ok(products);
        }

        // GET: api/Products/5
        // Caching Single Product by ID
        // The response is cached for 120 seconds
        // Different cache entries for different id values.
        [ResponseCache(Duration = 120, VaryByQueryKeys = new[] { "id" })]
        [HttpGet("{id}")]
        public async Task<ActionResult<Product>> GetProduct(int id)
        {
            // Retrieve a single product by ID
            var product = await _context.Products.FindAsync(id);

            if (product == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }

            // To show you the performance differences we delay the response for 3 seconds
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));

            return Ok(product);
        }

        // GET: api/Products/vary-query?sort=price
        // GET: api/Products/vary-query?sort=name
        // Caches different responses for 120 Seconds based on the value of the "sort" query parameter
        [ResponseCache(Duration = 120, VaryByQueryKeys = new[] { "sort" })]
        [HttpGet("vary-query")]
        public async Task<ActionResult<List<Product>>> GetProductsVaryByQuery([FromQuery] string sort)
        {
            var products = await _context.Products.ToListAsync();

            // Sort products based on the query parameter
            if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(sort))
            {
                if (sort.Equals("price", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
                {
                    products = products.OrderBy(p => p.Price).ToList();
                }
                else if (sort.Equals("name", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
                {
                    products = products.OrderBy(p => p.Name).ToList();
                }
            }

            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));
            return Ok(products);
        }

        // GET: api/Products/anylocation
        // Caching with Location = Any
        // The response can be cached by both client and proxy servers.
        [ResponseCache(Duration = 60, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.Any)]
        [HttpGet("anylocation")]
        public async Task<ActionResult<List<Product>>> GetProductsAnyLocation()
        {
            var products = await _context.Products.ToListAsync();
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));
            return Ok(products);
        }

        // GET: api/Products/clientlocation
        // Caching with Location = Client
        // The response is cached only on the client.
        [ResponseCache(Duration = 60, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.Client)]
        [HttpGet("clientlocation")]
        public async Task<ActionResult<List<Product>>> GetProductsClientLocation()
        {
            var products = await _context.Products.ToListAsync();
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));
            return Ok(products);
        }

        // GET: api/Products/nolocation
        // Caching with Location = None
        // The response will not cached by any cache.
        [ResponseCache(Duration = 60, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None)]
        [HttpGet("nolocation")]
        public async Task<ActionResult<List<Product>>> GetProductsNoLocation()
        {
            var products = await _context.Products.ToListAsync();
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));
            return Ok(products);
        }

        // GET: api/Products/nostore
        // Caching with NoStore = true
        // The response will not be cached in any cache.
        [ResponseCache(NoStore = true)]
        [HttpGet("nostore")]
        public async Task<ActionResult<List<Product>>> GetProductsNoStore()
        {
            var products = await _context.Products.ToListAsync();
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));
            return Ok(products);
        }

        // GET: api/Products/varybyheader
        // Caching with VaryByHeader = "User-Agent"
        // The response cache will vary based on the User-Agent header.
        [ResponseCache(Duration = 60, VaryByHeader = "User-Agent")]
        [HttpGet("varybyheader")]
        public async Task<ActionResult<List<Product>>> GetProductsVaryByHeader()
        {
            var products = await _context.Products.ToListAsync();
            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));
            return Ok(products);
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Response Caching Header:**

The [ResponseCache] attribute sets the appropriate HTTP headers (**Cache-Control**) to instruct clients and proxies to cache the responses

- **public:** This directive indicates that the response can be cached by any cache, including both client-side caches (like browser caches) and shared caches (like proxy servers and CDNs). This means the response is available to all users and devices that request it.
- **private:** This directive allows the response to be cached only by the client’s browser, not by any shared cache. It is useful for responses that contain user-specific or sensitive data, ensuring it remains private to the specific user making the request.
- **max-age:** This directive specifies the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that the cached response is considered fresh. During this time period, the cached version can be served without needing to contact the origin server for validation. For example, max-age=3600 means the response is fresh for 1 hour.
- **no-cache:** This directive indicates that the client should not cache the response. But the proxy server can cache the response.
- **no-store:** This directive indicates that the response will not be cached at all, neither by client-side nor by the proxy server. It is typically used when dealing with sensitive or confidential information that should not be stored anywhere.

##### **Swagger Behavior:**

When testing APIs, Swagger UI generally respects the HTTP caching headers sent by the server. This means that if your ASP.NET Core application sends a response with Cache-Control set to private, max-age=300, Swagger UI will cache the response as instructed for the duration specified. Subsequent requests to the same endpoint (within the cache duration) might not hit the server if the cached response is deemed valid.

##### **Postman Behavior:**

However, Postman does not automatically cache responses like a typical web browser would, despite receiving the same caching headers. In Postman, whenever you hit the “Send” button, a new request is made to the server, ignoring any previous response cache headers. This is intentional, as Postman is designed for testing and development, where you often need to see live server responses without caching interference.

##### **Testing Each Response Caching**

To effectively test the caching behavior of each action method, we can use tools like Swager, Fiddler, Postman, etc. The key is to inspect the HTTP response headers, particularly the Cache-Control header, to understand how caching is handled.

##### **GetProducts – api/Products**

It demonstrates caching with **Duration = 60** seconds.

**Expected Behavior:**

- First Request: Takes longer (3-second delay) and caches the response.
- Subsequent Requests (within 60 seconds): Faster response from the cache.

**Response Headers:**

- **Cache-Control: public,max-age=60**

**How to Test:**

- Send a GET request to https://localhost:{PORT}/api/Products using Swagger or Fiddler.
- Note the response time (should include the 3-second delay).
- Send the same request again within 60 seconds.
- Observe a faster response time, indicating it was served from the cache.
- Inspect the Cache-Control header to verify caching directives.

##### **GetProduct – api/Products/{id}**

It demonstrates caching with Duration = 120 seconds and VaryByQueryKeys = “id”.

**Expected Behavior:**

- First Request for a Specific ID: Takes longer and caches the response.
- Subsequent Requests for the Same ID (within 120 seconds): Faster response from the cache.
- Requests for Different IDs: Each ID has its own cache entry.

**Response Headers:**

- Cache-Control: public,max-age=120

**How to Test:**

- Send a GET request to https://localhost:{PORT}/api/Products/1.
- Note the response time (includes 3-second delay).
- Send the same request again within 120 seconds.
- Observe a faster response, indicating cached data.
- Send a request for a different ID, e.g., https://localhost:{PORT}/api/Products/2.
- Each unique ID will have its own cache entry.

##### **GetProductsAnyLocation – api/Products/anylocation**

It demonstrates caching with Location = ResponseCacheLocation.Any.

**Expected Behavior:**

- The response can be cached by both client and proxy servers.

**Response Headers:**

- Cache-Control: public,max-age=60

**How to Test:**

- Send a GET request to https://localhost:{PORT}/api/Products/anylocation.
- Observe the Cache-Control header is set to public,max-age=60.

##### **GetProductsClientLocation – api/Products/clientlocation**

It demonstrates caching with Location = ResponseCacheLocation.Client.

**Expected Behavior:**

- Response is cached only on the client side.
- Intermediate proxies should not cache the response.

**Response Headers:**

- Cache-Control: private,max-age=60

**How to Test:**

- Send a GET request to https://localhost:{PORT}/api/Products/clientlocation.
- Observe the Cache-Control header is set to private,max-age=60.
- Verify that only the client caches the response and no proxies cache it.

##### **GetProductsNoLocation – api/Products/nolocation**

It demonstrates caching with Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None.

**Expected Behavior:**

- Response should not be cached by any cache, regardless of Duration.

**Response Headers:**

- Cache-Control: no-cache,no-store

**How to Test:**

- Send a GET request to https://localhost:{PORT}/api/Products/nolocation.
- Observe the Cache-Control header is set to no-cache, no-store.
- Subsequent requests should always fetch fresh data from the server, bypassing any cache.

##### **GetProductsNoStore – api/Products/nostore**

It demonstrates caching with NoStore = true.

**Expected Behavior:**

- The response will not be stored in any cache.
- NoStore takes precedence over other caching directives.

**Response Headers:**

- Cache-Control: no-store

**How to Test:**

- Send a GET request to https://localhost:{PORT}/api/Products/nostore.
- Observe the Cache-Control header is set to no-store.
- Verify that the response is not cached by any client or proxy, regardless of any other caching headers.

##### **GetProductsVaryByHeader – api/Products/varybyheader**

It demonstrates caching with VaryByHeader = “User-Agent”.

**Expected Behavior:**

- Caches different responses based on the User-Agent header.
- Different clients (e.g., different browsers or devices) receive their own cached responses.

**Response Headers:**

- Cache-Control: public,max-age=60
- Vary: User-Agent

**How to Test:**

- Send a GET request to https://localhost:{PORT}/api/Products/varybyheader using different User-Agent headers.
- Observe that each unique User-Agent results in a separate cache entry.
- The Vary: User-Agent header indicates that the cache varies based on the User-Agent.

##### **Custom Cache Profile with Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API**

In ASP.NET Core Web API, Custom Cache Profiles allows us to define Reusable Response Cache Settings that can be applied across multiple actions or controllers. These profiles are defined in the application’s configuration, typically in the **Program.cs** class file, and can then be referenced by its name in controllers. Let us understand this with an example. First, modify the Program class as follows:

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using ResponseCachingDemo.Models;
namespace ResponseCachingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            // Add services to the container.

            builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
                options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

            // Register Response Caching services
            builder.Services.AddResponseCaching();

            builder.Services.AddControllers(options =>
            {
                //Creating Custom Cache Profiles
                options.CacheProfiles.Add("Default60", new CacheProfile()
                {
                    Duration = 60,
                    Location = ResponseCacheLocation.Any
                });
            });

            // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle
            builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
            builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

            var app = builder.Build();

            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            // Enable Response Caching Middleware
            app.UseResponseCaching();

            app.MapControllers();

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

**Here, we have configured one cache profile (Default60), as shown in the below image:**

**![Custom Cache Profile with Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22817%22%20height=%22292%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Custom Cache Profile with Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API")**

##### **Using Cache Profile in Response Cache Attribute:**

Once we define the Cache Profiles, they can be used within controller actions using the CacheProfileName Property of the ResponseCache attribute by referring to the profile name. So, modify the ProductsController as follows. We have specified the Default60 Cache profile within the GetProducts Action method.

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using ResponseCachingDemo.Models;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace ResponseCachingDemo.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

        public ProductsController(ApplicationDbContext context)
        {
            _context = context;
        }

        // GET: api/Products
        // Caching All Products
        [ResponseCache(CacheProfileName = "Default60")]
        [HttpGet]
        public async Task<ActionResult<List<Product>>> GetProducts()
        {
            // Retrieve all products from the database
            var products = await _context.Products.ToListAsync();

            return Ok(products);
        }
    }
}
```

##### **When Should We Use Response Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

By implementing response caching in the ASP.NET Core Web API application, we can significantly improve performance, reduce server load, and enhance the user experience. Response Caching is suitable for scenarios such as:

- **Data that Rarely Changes:** When the data does not change frequently and does not need to be refreshed on every request (e.g., product lists, static resources).
- **Response Reusability:** When responses can be reused for a certain period, the application server and database load are reduced, and response time is improved.
- **Repeated Requests:** When multiple clients request the same resource, cached responses reduce redundant processing.

**Note:** Avoid caching sensitive or frequently changing data unless there are proper mechanisms for invalidating the cache.
