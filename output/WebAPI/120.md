## **Database Design of Hotel Booking Application**

In this article, I will discuss the **Database Design of a Hotel Booking Application**. Please read our previous articles discussing the [**Different Modules in a Hotel Booking Application**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/modules-in-hotel-booking-application/).

##### **Database Design of Hotel Booking Application**

Designing a database for a hotel booking application involves creating schemas that can manage everything from room reservations and guest information to payments and staff administration. The following are the Key Entities involved in the Hotel Booking Application.

- **UserRoles:** This entity manages different roles within the system, such as Administrator, Manager, or Guest. It can include fields such as RoleID, RoleName, IsActive, and Description.
- **Users:** This entity stores information about users who can log into the system, possibly including staff and guests if they have accounts. It can include fields such as UserID, RoleID, Email, PasswordHash, CreatedAt, LastLogin, IsActive, etc.
- **Countries:** This entity holds information about countries, potentially for address management in user profiles or reservations. It can include fields such as CountryID, CountryName, CountryCode, and IsActive.
- **States:** This entity manages state information linked to countries, which is used similarly for address management. It can include fields such as StateID, StateName, CountryID, and IsActive.
- **RoomTypes:** This entity defines the types of rooms available in the hotel, such as standard, deluxe, and suite, each possibly with different amenities. It can include fields such as RoomTypeID, TypeName, AccessibilityFeatures, Description, IsActive, etc.
- **Rooms:** Details of individual rooms available at the hotel are linked to their Room Types. This entity can include fields such as RoomID, RoomNumber, RoomTypeID, Price, BedType, ViewType, Status, IsActive, etc.
- **Amenities:** This entity describes amenities available in the hotel that can be linked to room types or rooms. It can include fields such as AmenityID, Name, Description, IsActive, etc.
- **RoomAmenities:** Links room types to amenities, indicating which amenities are available in which room types.
- **Guests:** This entity stores information about hotel guests, potentially linked to users if they have accounts. It can include fields such as GuestID, UserID, FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone, AgeGroup, Address, CountryID, StateID, etc.
- **Reservations:** This entity manages booking information for hotel rooms, including guest details and stay duration. It can include fields such as ReservationID, UserID, RoomID, BookingDate, CheckInDate, CheckOutDate, NumberOfGuests, Status, etc.
- **PaymentBatches:** This entity manages batches of payments made by users, possibly for group bookings or corporate clients. It can include fields such as PaymentBatchID, UserID, PaymentDate, TotalAmount, PaymentMethod, etc.
- **Payments:** This entity tracks individual payments linked to reservations and batches. It can include fields such as PaymentID, ReservationID, Amount, PaymentBatchID, etc.
- **Cancellations:** Records details about reservation cancellations, including fees and status. This entity can include fields such as CancellationID, ReservationID, CancellationDate, Reason, CancellationFee, CancellationStatus, etc.
- **RefundMethods:** Stores different methods available for processing refunds. This entity can include fields such as MethodID, MethodName, IsActive, etc.
- **Refunds:** This entity manages refund transactions linked to specific payments. It can include fields such as RefundID, PaymentID, RefundAmount, RefundDate, RefundReason, RefundMethodID, ProcessedByUserID, RefundStatus, etc.
- **Feedback:** This entity collects feedback from guests regarding their stay linked to their reservation. It can include fields such as FeedbackID, ReservationID, GuestID, Rating, Comment, FeedbackDate, etc.

#### **Creating Hotel Booking Database:**

Please execute the following SQL Script on the SQL Server Database, which will create the required Database with the required tables. As per your requirements, you can add a few more columns to the database tables. In fact, as we progress in this Hotel Application development, we may add a few more columns. Let us first create the database, then we will understand the Role and responsibilities of each column of each database tables.
