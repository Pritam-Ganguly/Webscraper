##### **What is Serilog in ASP.NET Core?**

Serilog is a popular, high-performance, structured logging library for .NET applications, including ASP.NET Core, that provides developers with a powerful and flexible way to capture, store, and analyze log data. Unlike traditional logging, which often captures log messages as simple text, structured logging allows us to log data in a structured format (usually JSON) that can be easily queried and analyzed.

In the context of an ASP.NET Core Application, Serilog can be used to log HTTP requests, responses, exceptions, and custom messages that developers want to track. It also supports logging to various sinks (outputs), such as the console, files, databases, etc.

##### **How to Implement Serilog in ASP.NET Core?**

Let us understand the step-by-step process for implementing Serilog in an ASP.NET Core Web API project. First, create a new ASP.NET Core Web API Project named **LoggingDemo**.

##### **Step 1: Install Serilog NuGet Packages**

We need to start by installing Serilog packages that enable logging to different destinations (sinks). Commonly used packages include:

- **Serilog.AspNetCore:** Integrates Serilog with ASP.NET Core applications.
- **Serilog.Sinks.Console:** This allows output to be logged into the console. It is useful during development to monitor logs in real-time. A “sink” in Serilog terminology is an output destination for your logs.
- **Serilog.Sinks.File:** Enables logging to files on disk. This is for persistent logging, enabling the analysis of logs over time or after specific events. Logs stored in files can be reviewed later for troubleshooting, auditing, or monitoring the application’s behavior.
- **Serilog.Settings.Configuration:** This package enables Serilog to be configured via the ASP.NET Core appsettings.json file.
- **Serilog.Sinks.Async:** This package is used for asynchronous logging.

You can install these packages via the NuGet Package Manager for Solution or the Package Manager Console. So, open the Package Manager Console and execute the following commands:

- **Install-Package Serilog.AspNetCore**
- **Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.Console**
- **Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.File**
- **Install-Package Serilog.Settings.Configuration**
- **Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.Async**

Once you execute the above commands, you can then verify the Packages inside the Dependencies/Packages folder, as shown in the below image:

![How to Implement Serilog in ASP.NET Core?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22487%22%20height=%22291%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to Implement Serilog in ASP.NET Core?")

##### **Step 2: Configure Serilog in Program.cs**

In Program.cs, configure Serilog to initialize before the host is built. This setup ensures Serilog captures logs throughout the application. Please modify the Program class as follows.

```
using Serilog;
namespace LoggingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            // Add services to the container.
            builder.Services.AddControllers();
            builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
            builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

            // Configure Serilog for logging
            Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
                .ReadFrom.Configuration(builder.Configuration)
                .WriteTo.Console()
                .WriteTo.File("logs/MyAppLog.txt")
                .CreateLogger();

            // Set Serilog as the logging provider
            // This will also replace default logging provider with Serilog
            builder.Host.UseSerilog();

            var app = builder.Build();

            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.MapControllers();

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

The following code snippet configures the Serilog logging library for use in an ASP.NET Core Web API project. It sets up how logging should be performed within the application, including where logs should be written and what additional data should be included with each log entry.

![Configure Serilog in Program.cs](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22866%22%20height=%22321%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Configure Serilog in Program.cs")

##### **Code Explanation:**

- **Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration():** Creates a new Serilog logger.
- **.ReadFrom.Configuration(builder.Configuration):** Reads settings from appsettings.json, providing flexibility in changing log levels and destinations without modifying code.
- **.WriteTo.Console():** Logs directly to the console, useful in development for real-time feedback.
- **.WriteTo.File(“logs/MyAppLog.txt”):** Writes logs to a specified file, providing persenabling long-term storage and analysis of log data.
- **.CreateLogger();:** Finally, this line builds the logger instance with the configured settings and assigns it to the static Log.Logger property.

##### **Step 3: Update appsettings.json**

Please modify the appsettings.json file as follows. The following JSON is the configuration for the Serilog logging library within an ASP.NET Core application. It specifies how Serilog should behave, including where it should output logs, the minimum log level, and any additional data to include with each log entry.

```
{
  "Serilog": {
    "Using": [ "Serilog.Sinks.Console", "Serilog.Sinks.File" ],
    "MinimumLevel": "Information",
    "WriteTo": [
      { "Name": "Console" },
      {
        "Name": "File",
        "Args": {
          "path": "logs/MyAppLog-.txt",
          "rollingInterval": "Day"
        }
      }
    ],
    "Properties": {
      "Application": "App-LoggingDemo",
      "Server": "Server-125.08.13.1"
    }
  }
}
```

Here’s a breakdown of each section:

###### **Serilog**

This is the root element for Serilog configuration settings within the appsettings.json file, indicating that all configurations within it are meant for Serilog.

###### **“Using”: [ “Serilog.Sinks.Console”, “Serilog.Sinks.File” ]:**

This specifies the sinks (or outputs) that Serilog will use. A sink is where logs are sent, in this case, to the console and files. These strings correspond to NuGet packages that need to be included in your project for these sinks to work. We have already added these packages to Step 1.

###### **“MinimumLevel”: “Information”:**

This sets the minimum log level for events to be written to the configured sinks. Serilog has various log levels (Verbose, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Fatal) in ascending order of severity. In this example, it’s set to “Information,” which means that only log events with a level of Information, Warning, Error, or Fatal will be logged. Verbose and Debug level events will be ignored.

###### **WriteTo:**

This is an array that configures sinks and their settings. Each sink can be further configured with its own set of arguments.

**![How to Implement Logging using Serilog in ASP.NET Core Web API](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22492%22%20height=%22315%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to Implement Logging using Serilog in ASP.NET Core Web API")**

Each sink has a Name, and some sinks have additional Args.

1. **Name: Console:** This entry specifies that logs should be written to the console. It doesn’t require any additional arguments.
2. **Name: File:** This specifies that logs should also be written to a file. It includes arguments for further configuration:

- - **path:** Defines the path and file name pattern for the log files. “**logs/MyAppLog-.txt**” suggests that logs will be written to the logs directory, with files named starting with MyAppLog-. The – is a placeholder for dynamic content, such as date or file number, based on the rolling interval settings.
    - **rollingInterval:** Specifies how often a new log file should be created. In this case, “**Day**” means a new file will be created daily. Other options include **Hour, Minute, Month**, **Year**, etc.

###### **Properties:**

This section defines global properties that will be included with every log event. Here, we have added properties named Application and Server. This is useful for filtering logs, especially if multiple applications log into the same sink.

```
"Properties": {
      "Application": "App-LoggingDemo",
      "Server": "Server-125.08.13.1"
}
```

##### **Step 4: Use Logging in Your Application**

With Serilog configured, we can inject and use the ILogger<T> interface in our controllers or other services to log messages throughout the application. For example, create a Test API Controller and copy and paste the following code.

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace LoggingDemo.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class TestController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ILogger<TestController> _logger;

        public TestController(ILogger<TestController> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpGet("all-logs")]
        public IActionResult LogAllLevels()
        {
            _logger.LogTrace("LogTrace: Entering the LogAllLevels endpoint with Trace-level logging.");

            // Simulate a variable and log it at Trace level
            int calculation = 5 * 10;
            _logger.LogTrace("LogTrace: Calculation value is {calculation}", calculation);

            _logger.LogDebug("LogDebug: Initializing debug-level logs for debugging purposes.");

            // Log some debug information
            var debugInfo = new { Action = "LogAllLevels", Status = "Debugging" };
            _logger.LogDebug("LogDebug: Debug information: {@debugInfo}", debugInfo);

            _logger.LogInformation("LogInformation: The LogAllLevels endpoint was reached successfully.");

            // Simulate a condition that might cause an issue
            bool resourceLimitApproaching = true;
            if (resourceLimitApproaching)
            {
                _logger.LogWarning("LogWarning: Resource usage is nearing the limit. Action may be required soon.");
            }

            try
            {
                // Simulate an error scenario
                int x = 0;
                int result = 10 / x;
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                _logger.LogError(ex, "LogError: An error occurred while processing the request.");
            }

            // Log a critical error scenario
            bool criticalFailure = true;
            if (criticalFailure)
            {
                _logger.LogCritical("LogCritical: A critical system failure has been detected. Immediate attention is required.");
            }

            return Ok("All logging levels demonstrated in this endpoint.");
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Step 5: Run and Test**

Run the application and access the above endpoints. You should see logs appearing in the console and log files in the logs directory. In the Console Window, you will see the following:

![Serilog in the ASP.NET Core Web API](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221466%22%20height=%22672%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Serilog in the ASP.NET Core Web API")

Now, it should have created the logs folder in your project, and inside this folder, you will find two text files. This is because we have configured Serilog in both **Program.cs** class file and **appsettings.json** file. For the Program.cs class file configuration, it will generate **MyAppLog.txt** file, and for the configuration in appsettings.json file, it will create the **MyAppLog-20240320.txt** (YYYYMMDD) file as shown in the below image:

![How Do We Implement Serilog in ASP.NET Core Web API?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22942%22%20height=%22257%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How Do We Implement Serilog in ASP.NET Core Web API?")

##### **How Do We Implement Structured Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API with Serilog**

Structured logging focuses on capturing and organizing log data in a JSON Format rather than traditional plain text, making it easy to query and analyze using log management tools. Let us see an example of implementing structured logging using Serilog in the ASP.NET Core Web API application. We will create a simple Book Management application that logs various types of structured log messages.

##### **Create a Model and Controller**

First, define a Book model. Add a folder named **Models,** and then add a class file named **Book.cs** within the Models folder. Copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace LoggingDemo.Models
{
    public class Book
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Author { get; set; }
        public int YearPublished { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Next, create an API Empty Controller named **BooksController** within the Controllers folder and then copy and paste the following code, which adds actions to add and retrieve books. Here, we will log structured data about the operations being performed:

```
using LoggingDemo.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace LoggingDemo.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class BooksController : ControllerBase
    {
        private static List<Book> Books = new List<Book>()
        {
            new Book(){Id = 1001, Title = "ASP.NET Core", Author = "Pranaya", YearPublished = 2019},
            new Book(){Id = 1001, Title = "SQL Server", Author = "Pranaya", YearPublished = 2022}
        };
        private readonly ILogger<BooksController> _logger;

        public BooksController(ILogger<BooksController> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult AddBook([FromBody] Book book)
        {
            Books.Add(book);

            //Structured Logging, i.e., JSON Format
            _logger.LogInformation("Added a new book {@Book}", book);
            return Ok();
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public IActionResult GetBooks()
        {
            //Structured Logging, i.e., JSON Format
            _logger.LogInformation("Retrieved all books. Books: {@Books}", Books);
            return Ok(Books);
        }
    }
}
```

In the above controller, the AddBook action logs the entire book object as structured data using the @ operator, which tells Serilog to treat the book object as structured data rather than converting it to a string. The GetBooks action logs all the books as structured data using the @ operator.

##### **Centralizing the Serilog Configuration in AppSettings.Json File:**

You can also centralize the Serilog configuration settings within the appsettings.json file instead of partially in Program.cs and appsettings.json. We can achieve this by using the S**erilog.Settings.Configuration** package, which we have already installed. So, modify the appsettings.json file as follows.

```
{
  "Using": [ "Serilog.Sinks.Console", "Serilog.Sinks.File" ],
  "Serilog": {
    "MinimumLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Override": {
        "Microsoft": "Warning",
        "System": "Error"
      }
    },
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "Console"
      },
      {
        "Name": "File",
        "Args": {
          "path": "logs/MyAppLog-.txt",
          "rollingInterval": "Day",
          "outputTemplate": "{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}"
        }
      }
    ],
    "Properties": {
      "Application": "App-LoggingDemo",
      "Server": "Server-125.08.13.1"
    }
  }
}
```

##### **Understanding the above Modified Code:**

###### **MinimumLevel**

- **Default:** Specifies the minimum log level that will be captured globally. Here, it’s set to “Information”, meaning that logs of Information level and higher (Warning, Error, Fatal) will be recorded, while Verbose and Trace level logs will be ignored.
- **Override:** Allows specifying different minimum log levels for specific namespaces.
    - 1. **“Microsoft” is set to “Warning”,** meaning log events from Microsoft’s libraries will only be recorded at Warning level and above, ignoring Information and lower levels.
        2. **“System” is set to “Error”**, so only Error and Fatal log levels from System namespaces will be recorded, providing a way to reduce the logs from these sources.

###### **WriteTo**

**outputTemplate:** Defines the format of each log entry. **{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}** specifies that each log should start with a timestamp in a specific format, followed by the log level (three-letter abbreviation), the log message, after log message a new line, and finally, the exception details if an exception is being logged. **lj stands for “literal JSON”**, ensuring that structured data is logged as JSON literals.

##### **Initialize Serilog in Program.cs**

Now, in the Program.cs file, instead of configuring Serilog directly with code, we will load the Serilog configuration from appsettings.json file. We don’t need to explicitly set up the logger with sinks or filters here, as those are now managed in your configuration file. So, modify the Program class as follows. The following code is self-explained, so please read the comment lines for a better understanding.

```
using Serilog;
namespace LoggingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            // Add services to the container.
            builder.Services.AddControllers();
            builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
            builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

            // Configuring the HostBuilder to use Serilog as the logging provider

            // context: An instance of HostBuilderContext that provides access to the application's configuration and environment, such as environment variables or appsettings.json values.
            // services:  The application's IServiceProvider, used for dependency injection.
            // configuration: An instance of LoggerConfiguration used to configure Serilog.
            builder.Host.UseSerilog((context, services, configuration) =>
            {
                // Reads configuration settings for Serilog from the appsettings.json file or any other configuration source
                // This enables setting options such as log levels, sinks, and output formats directly from configuration files.
                configuration.ReadFrom.Configuration(context.Configuration);

                // Allows Serilog to integrate with other services registered in the Dependency Injection (DI) container
                // This is useful if any of the logging sinks require dependencies that are registered in DI,
                // allowing them to access services such as database or HTTP context.
                configuration.ReadFrom.Services(services);
            });

            var app = builder.Build();

            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.MapControllers();

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Testing and Observing Structured Logs**

Run your application and use Swagger, Postman, or Fiddler to test the API endpoints. For example, to add a new book, you could POST to **https://localhost:7223/api/books** with a JSON body:

```
{
    "id": 1003,
    "title": "C#.NET",
    "author": "Pranaya",
    "yearPublished": 2023
}
```

Once you access the endpoint with the above request body, you can verify the Console window, and it should display the following message:

![Structured Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221023%22%20height=%2257%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Structured Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API")

Now, if you open the MyAppLog-20240320 txt file, then you will also see the same log as shown in the below image:

![Structured Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API with Serilog](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221302%22%20height=%22167%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Structured Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API with Serilog")

Similarly, you can also check the other GET Endpoint and observe the logs. Now, if you observe one thing, in the appsettings file we have specified the following Properties, but this is not printed in the logs.

```
"Properties": {
  "Application": "App-LoggingDemo",
  "Server": "Server-125.08.13.1"
}
```

To log the additional context from Properties (such as Application name and server IP address), we need to ensure that the outputTemplate in appsettings.json explicitly includes placeholders for these properties.

The current template we are using doesn’t include placeholders for Application and Server, so they aren’t displayed in the logs. We are currently using the following template, which doesn’t include placeholders for Application and Server.

**“outputTemplate”: “{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}”**

To include the properties, modify the outputTemplate in the File and Console sink configuration in appsettings.json as follows. Add placeholders for {Application} and {Server} to the outputTemplate in the appsettings.json file as follows.

**“outputTemplate”: “{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] [{Application}/{Server}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}”**

##### **Modifying AppSettings.Json File**

So, modify the appsettings.json file as follows to include the placeholders for {Application} and {Server} in the outputTemplate:

```
{
  "Serilog": {
    "Using": [ "Serilog.Sinks.Console", "Serilog.Sinks.File" ],
    "MinimumLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Override": {
        "Microsoft": "Warning",
        "System": "Error"
      }
    },
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "Console",
        "Args": {
          "outputTemplate": "{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] [{Application}/{Server}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}"
        }
      },
      {
        "Name": "File",
        "Args": {
          "path": "logs/MyAppLog-.txt",
          "rollingInterval": "Day",
          "outputTemplate": "{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] [{Application}/{Server}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}"
        }
      }
    ],
    "Properties": {
      "Application": "App-LoggingDemo",
      "Server": "Server-125.08.13.1"
    }
  }
}
```

Add a book using the following data with the above changes in place.

```
{
  "id": 101,

**Note:** Using the properties is optional. If you don’t want them, you can remove them.

##### **How do we Remove the Older Text files using Serilog in ASP.NET Core Web API with Configurations?**

Managing log files is essential for maintaining the performance and health of your ASP.NET Core Web API application. Over time, log files can consume significant disk space, leading to potential storage issues. Serilog provides a rolling file mechanism that allows us to automatically archive and delete older log files based on criteria like file age, size, or date. This helps keep the logging system manageable, preventing the log files from consuming too much disk space.

##### **Configure Serilog in appsettings.json to Implement Rolling Policies**

In appsettings.json, we can configure Serilog’s file rolling policies and log retention settings. This configuration ensures that logs older than the specified retention period are automatically deleted, keeping your logging system manageable and preventing excessive disk space usage.

So, please modify the appsettings.json file as follows. The following configuration creates a new log file each day, retains only the latest 30 files, and starts a new file if the size exceeds 10 MB:

```
{
  "Serilog": {
    "Using": [ "Serilog.Sinks.Console", "Serilog.Sinks.File" ],
    "MinimumLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Override": {
        "Microsoft": "Warning",
        "System": "Error"
      }
    },
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "File",
        "Args": {
          "path": "logs/MyAppLog-.txt",
          "rollingInterval": "Day",
          "retainedFileCountLimit": 30, // Retain last 30 log files
          "fileSizeLimitBytes": 100000, // 10 MB per file
          "rollOnFileSizeLimit": true,
          "outputTemplate": "{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

##### **Explanation of Key Parameters for Log Retention Management**

- **rollingInterval:** Specifies the frequency with which new log files are created. Setting “Day” ensures a new file is created daily. Other options include Minute, Hour, Month, etc.
- **retainedFileCountLimit:** Limits the number of log files retained. Once the limit (e.g., 30 files) is reached, the oldest files are automatically deleted. This prevents disk space from being consumed by outdated logs.
- **fileSizeLimitBytes:** Sets the maximum size of each log file. Here, the limit is 10 MB per file. When the file reaches this size, a new file is created.
- **rollOnFileSizeLimit:** When set to true, this option ensures that the file rolls over to a new file once it reaches the specified size limit (fileSizeLimitBytes).

##### **Benefits of Configuring Log Retention**

- **Automatic Cleanup:** With retainedFileCountLimit, we avoid manually managing log files, as older files are automatically deleted.
- **Disk Space Optimization:** Restricting log file size (fileSizeLimitBytes) and retention count (retainedFileCountLimit) optimizes server storage, especially for high-traffic applications.
- **Improved Performance:** File rollovers prevent a single, oversized log file, which could slow down file I/O operations.

##### **How Do We Implement Asynchronous Logging with Serilog in ASP.NET Core?**

Asynchronous logging is a technique where log messages are written to the log destination without blocking the main execution thread. This improves performance, especially in high-traffic applications, by offloading the I/O operations associated with logging to background threads. In ASP.NET Core applications, Serilog supports asynchronous logging through the **Serilog.Sinks.Async** package.

Serilog doesn’t perform asynchronous logging by default. We need to implement asynchronous logging with Serilog in an ASP.NET Core application. Let’s proceed to understand how to configure Serilog for asynchronous logging in your ASP.NET Core application.

##### **Install Required Package:**

First, we need to install the Serilog.Sinks.Async package. You can do this via the Package Manager Console by executing the below command:

**Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.Async**

##### **Configure Serilog Async Sink in the appsettings.json file:**

In appsettings.json file, we can specify configurations for logging, which Serilog reads to configure itself. So, modify the appsettings.json as follows to enable asynchronous logging with common log destinations like Console and File.

```
{
  "Serilog": {
    "Using": [ "Serilog.Sinks.Console", "Serilog.Sinks.File", "Serilog.Sinks.Async" ],
    "MinimumLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Override": {
        "Microsoft": "Warning",
        "System": "Error"
      }
    },
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "Async",
        "Args": {
          "configure": [
            {
              "Name": "Console",
              "Args": {
                "outputTemplate": "{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] [{Application}/{Server}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}"
              }
            },
            {
              "Name": "File",
              "Args": {
                "path": "logs/MyAppLog-.txt",
                "rollingInterval": "Day",
                "retainedFileCountLimit": 30,
                "fileSizeLimitBytes": 10485760,
                "rollOnFileSizeLimit": true,
                "outputTemplate": "{Timestamp:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff zzz} [{Level:u3}] [{Application}/{Server}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ],
    "Properties": {
      "Application": "App-LoggingDemo",
      "Server": "Server-125.08.13.1"
    }
  }
}
```

##### **Explanation:**

- “Using”: [“Serilog.Sinks.Async”] includes the Async package, enabling asynchronous operations.
- “WriteTo”: Configures the sinks. Each sink that should be asynchronous is wrapped with “Name”: “Async”.
- “Args”: { “configure”: [ … ] }: Contains the configuration for the sink inside the asynchronous wrapper.
- The Async sink wraps around each logging sink (e.g., Console and File), ensuring that both are processed asynchronously.

Now, run the application, and it should work as expected. If you want, you can also configure asynchronous logging in the Program class. For a better understanding, please modify the Program class as follows:

```
using Serilog;
namespace LoggingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            // Add services to the container.
            builder.Services.AddControllers();
            builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
            builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

            // Configuring the HostBuilder to use Serilog as the logging provider
            builder.Host.UseSerilog((context, services, configuration) =>
            {
                // Reads configuration settings for Serilog from the appsettings.json file or any other configuration source
                // This enables setting options such as log levels, sinks, and output formats directly from configuration files.
                configuration.ReadFrom.Configuration(context.Configuration);

                // Allows Serilog to integrate with other services registered in the Dependency Injection (DI) container
                // This is useful if any of the logging sinks require dependencies that are registered in DI,
                // allowing them to access services such as database or HTTP context.
                configuration.ReadFrom.Services(services);

                // Enables asynchronous logging for all sinks
                configuration.WriteTo.Async(a =>
                {
                    // You can add multiple sinks here, for example, File or Console
                    a.Console();  // Enables asynchronous logging to the Console
                    a.File("logs/log-.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day, retainedFileCountLimit: 30);  // Enables async logging to file sink
                });
            });

            var app = builder.Build();

            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.MapControllers();

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Benefits of Asynchronous Logging:**

The following are some of the benefits of Asynchronous logging.

- **Non-Blocking Performance:** Logging can be an expensive operation, especially when writing to sinks like files, databases, or cloud-based services. Asynchronous logging ensures that these operations do not block the execution of your main application, improving responsiveness.
- **Scalability:** In web applications handling multiple requests concurrently, blocking I/O operations (such as logging) can reduce the application’s scalability. By making logging asynchronous, the application can handle more requests simultaneously.
- **Better User Experience:** Non-blocking logging prevents end-users from experiencing delays caused by logging, resulting in a smoother and faster user experience.

With asynchronous logging in Serilog, we can achieve high-performance logging that scales well for production workloads. By configuring appsettings.json with the Async sink, we keep log operations non-blocking, avoid performance bottlenecks, and ensure that logs are managed efficiently.
