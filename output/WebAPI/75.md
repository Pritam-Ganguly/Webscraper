##### **NCache Installation Options**

When setting up NCache in your environment, it’s important to select the right installation type based on your particular requirements. NCache offers three different installation options, the following sections details these.

###### **Cache Server**

- **Purpose:** This is the core role of NCache. The Cache Server installation sets up the machine to host a cache. It includes all the necessary components and services required for the cache server to operate, manage, and store data.
- **Usage:** Cache servers are typically installed on dedicated server machines. These servers are part of a cluster that collectively forms the distributed cache architecture. Each server in the cluster can handle requests for cache data, and they work together to ensure data is evenly distributed and redundantly stored for high availability and performance.
- **Configuration:** Installing as a Cache Server often requires configuring network settings, cache topologies, and synchronization settings among multiple cache servers. It may also involve setting up security features and backup mechanisms.

###### **Developer/QA**

- **Purpose:** This installation option is tailored for development and testing environments rather than production. It typically includes tools and libraries necessary for integrating NCache into your applications and for testing the caching strategies and implementation.
- **Usage:** Developers and QA engineers install this role on their local machines or on dedicated development/test servers. It allows them to work with and test against an NCache environment without needing to interact with the actual production cache servers.
- **Configuration:** This role might include advanced debugging and testing tools. It allows for configurations that mimic the production environment or simulate various test scenarios. It’s crucial to ensure that applications handle caching as expected before going live.

###### **Remote Client (Optional)**

- **Purpose:** The Remote Client installation is designed for situations where application servers or other client machines need to interact with the cache server without hosting a part of the cache themselves.
- **Usage:** This role is suitable for application servers or client applications that are configured to use the cache but are not part of the cache cluster. These clients connect to the cache servers over the network to request and retrieve cached data.
- **Configuration:** Remote Clients require configuration to ensure they can locate and authenticate to the cache servers. This setup often involves security configurations to protect data in transit and to authenticate clients against the cache servers securely.

##### **Using the NCache Management Center**

Launch the NCache Management Center by browsing to **http://localhost:8251** or <server-ip>:8251 on Windows and Linux.

In the left navigation bar, click on Clustered Caches. This opens the Clustered Caches page at **<server-ip>:8251/ClusteredCaches/**. The page shows any existing clustered caches on your machine and additional details like Topology, Servers, and Server Platform, as shown in the image below. To create a new distributed cache, click on **New**.

![Using the NCache Management Center](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221331%22%20height=%22412%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Using the NCache Management Center")

It will open the following page. From the In-Memory Store Type dropdown menu, select Distributed Cache and specify the name of your cache. Select JSON or Binary from the Serialization dropdown menu as per your requirement. I am giving the cache name **MyClusteredCache1** and selecting the **JSON** Serialization. Then, click on the Next button, as shown in the image below.

**Note:** If a cache with the specified name already exists, you are prompted with an error message. If you are using ASP.NET 5.0 and above, use JSON serialization as a recommended approach.

Then, it will open the Caching Topology. Here, you need to select the caching topology and any advanced options like Operation Timeout and Statistic Replication Interval. I have selected the Replicated Cache and then clicked on the Next button, as shown in the image below.

![Using the NCache Management Center to Create a Cluster](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221750%22%20height=%22538%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Using the NCache Management Center to Create a Cluster")

From the next screen, specify the Maximum Size of the cache, if required. You can add cache nodes to the cluster by specifying the node IP address and clicking the Add Node button. To add more nodes, click Add Node. Once all the required nodes are added, click Next.

On Advanced Options page, you can configure the following settings:

- Eviction is enabled by default. You can configure the Eviction Policy accordingly. If you want to disable eviction, uncheck the check box Enable Eviction.
- You can also change the Eviction percentage; if eviction is enabled, items will be evicted from the cache using this percentage value.
- You can change the Clean interval value. The default is 15 seconds.
- If you have checked the Start this cache on Finish checkbox in this dialog box, it will start automatically upon the completion of this process.
- Checking the checkbox Auto start this cache on service startup will make the cache start automatically after the service restarts.
