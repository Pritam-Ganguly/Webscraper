## **Modules in Hotel Booking Application**

In this article, I will give you a brief Idea about the different Modules involved in a Hotel booking Application. A Hotel Management Web Application is a specific type of Application that runs over the Internet through a Web Browser. In this article series, I will show you how to Develop a Hotel Booking Real-Time Application using ASP.NET Core Web API step by step.

In this article, I will give you an idea of how we are going to develop the Hotel Booking Real-Time Application. From the next article, we are going to start the actual implementation. First, let us understand the different modules that we are going to develop as part of this hotel booking application.

#### **Hotel Booking Application Modules:**

The following are the different Modules we are going to develop.

##### **User Management Module**

- **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiate system access levels based on user roles such as Administrator, Manager, and Guest.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure user login processes and ensure that users can only access information and functions appropriate to their role.
- **User Profile Management:** Enable users to update their personal and contact information through a user-friendly interface.

##### **Search and Filter Module:**

- **Search:** This feature allows users to search for hotels based on various criteria, such as location, price range, hotel star rating, amenities, etc.
- **Filter:** Implements filters to refine search results.

##### **Hotel Management Module (for admins or hotel owners):**

- Enables hotel administrators to add, update, or remove hotel listings.
- Manages information such as room types, availability, prices, and hotel facilities.

##### **Amenities Management Module**

- **Amenities Setup and Mapping:** Define and manage the hotel’s various amenities, such as spas, pools, gyms, and business centers.

##### **Room Management Module**

- **Room Setup:** Define and categorize different types of rooms along with their features and availability status.
- **Room Availability Checking:** Provide real-time availability status of rooms to facilitate reservations.

##### **Notifications Module:**

- Sends automated emails or messages to users about booking confirmations, changes, cancellations, and promotional offers.
- Implements alerts for administrators for bookings, feedback, or issues that need attention.

**Note:** We will use SQL Server and ASP.NET Core Web API to develop this hotel booking real-time application. We are also going to use ASP.NET Core Identity and EF Core to manage security, including JWT Authentication.

In this article, I explain the different **Modules involved in the Hotel Booking Application** and all the Modules we are going to develop one by one in this article series. I hope you enjoy this article series. Please take a few minutes to give your valuable feedback about this article.
