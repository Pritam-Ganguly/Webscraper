## **Caching in ASP.NET Core**

In this article, I will provide a Brief Introduction to **Caching in ASP.NET Core** Applications. Please read our previous articles discussing [**Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/logging-in-asp-net-core-web-api/) with Examples.

##### **What is Caching?**

Caching is a technique for storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area called a cache. The purpose is to speed up data retrieval by avoiding expensive operations such as database queries, external API calls, or complex computations. By serving data from the cache, applications can reduce the load on database servers and improve the application performance, ultimately enhancing the user experience.

##### **What is Caching in ASP.NET Core?**

In ASP.NET Core, caching is a mechanism used to store commonly requested data (e.g., results of database queries, complex computations, static files, external API responses, or entire responses) in a temporary location for faster retrieval. By reducing repetitive processing and backend calls, caching improves overall application performance and enhances user experience.

In ASP.NET Core, caching is an integral part of building high-performance applications. It allows us to store data that is expensive to fetch or compute so that it can be quickly retrieved on subsequent requests.

##### **Why is Caching Important?**

Caching is crucial for improving application performance by reducing load on backend systems. By caching frequently requested data, we can significantly enhance user experience, decrease server workload, and minimize the cost of resource consumption by reducing the number of calls to databases or remote services. So, Caching is crucial for several reasons:

- **Performance Improvement:** Reduces the time required to retrieve data by serving it from faster storage mediums like cache.
- **Reduced Load on Backend Systems:** Caching minimizes the number of calls to databases or external services, thereby reducing the load on these systems.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Faster response times lead to a smoother and more responsive user experience.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reducing the number of expensive operations (like database queries) can lead to lower operational costs, especially in cloud-based environments where such operations may incur additional charges.

Consider an example where our application contains static data, such as a list of products, countries, states, cities, or configuration settings. Since this data does not change frequently, multiple users might request it simultaneously.

##### **Without Caching:**

Without caching, each request will hit the database, resulting in an increased load on the database server, as multiple round trips between the application server and the database server are needed. This ultimately reduces the overall application performance. For a better understanding, please look at the following diagram:

![Caching in ASP.NET Core](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22960%22%20height=%22428%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Caching in ASP.NET Core")

**Here,**

- Request: The user requests static data.
- Process: The application queries the database.
- Response: Data is fetched and sent back to the user.

This approach increases the load on the database server, leading to higher resource consumption and decreased performance, especially under heavy load.

##### **With Caching:**

However, with caching enabled, the first request will fetch the data from the database and store it in the cache. Subsequent requests for the same data will retrieve it directly from the cache, significantly reducing the number of database queries, decreasing server load, and improving application performance.

###### **First Request:**

- The application checks the cache. Data is not found (cache miss).
- Queries the database and retrieves the data.
- Stores the data in the cache.
- Sends the data to the user.

###### **Subsequent Requests:**

- The application checks the cache. Data is found (cache hit).
- Retrieves data from the cache.
- Sends the data to the user.

This reduces the number of database roundtrips, lowers server load, and improves response times.

##### **What is a Cache Hit and a Cache Miss?**

**Cache Hit:** A cache hit occurs when the requested data is found in the cache. This results in faster data retrieval since the application can serve the data directly from the cache without additional processing or fetching from the primary storage or database.

**Cache Miss:** A cache miss occurs when the requested data is not present in the cache. In this case, the application must retrieve the data from the primary storage (e.g., database or external API), which is typically slower than accessing the cache. After fetching, the data is usually added to the cache for future requests.

##### **What are the Different Types of Caching Available in ASP.NET Core?**

ASP.NET Core provides several caching mechanisms to optimize application performance:

##### **In-Memory Caching:**

This type of caching stores data in the web server’s memory. It is fast and easy to implement, making it ideal for single-server scenarios where we do not need to share cache across multiple servers.

- Stores data in the web server’s memory where the application is running.
- It is simple to implement and offers fast access.
- Ideal for single-server scenarios or development environments.
- Not shared across multiple servers or instances.

##### **Distributed Caching:**

This type of caching stores data in an external cache server, such as Redis or NCache, making it suitable for applications running on multiple servers in a load-balanced environment. Distributed caching ensures consistent caching across all application instances.

- Stores data in an external cache server (e.g., Redis, SQL Server, and NCache) accessible by multiple application instances.
- Suitable for applications running on multiple servers (load-balanced environments).
- Ensures data consistency across different instances of the application.

##### **Response Caching:**

Response caching stores the responses of HTTP requests to improve response times for similar requests. By caching the entire response, ASP.NET Core can serve repeated requests without executing the same processing logic each time.

- Caches the entire HTTP response.
- Improves response times by returning cached responses for identical requests.
- Uses HTTP headers to control caching behavior.
- Suitable for scenarios where the same data is requested frequently.

##### **Differences Between In-Memory Caching and Distributed Caching**

The following are the key Differences Between In-Memory Caching and Distributed Caching in ASP.NET Core:

###### **Storage Location**

- **In-Memory Caching:** Stored in the application’s local memory.
- **Distributed Caching:** Stored in an external cache server.

###### **Scalability**

- **In-Memory Caching:** Limited to a single server or instance.
- **Distributed Caching:** Supports multi-server environments, i.e., Load balancing environments.

###### **Data Sharing**

- **In-Memory Caching:** Data is not shared across multiple instances.
- **Distributed Caching:** Data is shared across all instances of the app.

###### **Persistence**

- **In-Memory Caching:** Volatile; data is lost on server restart.
- **Distributed Caching:** More durable; can persist data across restarts.

###### **Performance**

- **In-Memory Caching:** Extremely fast access times.
- **Distributed Caching:** Slightly slower due to network latency.

###### **Setup Complexity**

- **In-Memory Caching:** Simple to implement.
- **Distributed Caching:** More complex; requires additional infrastructure.

###### **Use Case**

- **In-Memory Caching:** Small applications, single server.
- **Distributed Caching:** Large-scale, distributed environments.

##### **When Should We Use a Distributed Cache Instead of an In-memory Cache?**

Distributed caching offers several advantages, especially when applications are deployed across multiple servers or instances, such as load-balanced web farms. In such scenarios, using an in-memory cache on each server can lead to inconsistent data across instances, whereas distributed caching provides a centralized cache, maintaining consistency and reliability. It is also more suitable for scenarios that require high availability and scalability since the cache is not tied to a single server.

- **Consistency:** A distributed cache ensures all instances have access to the same cached data in a load-balanced environment with multiple server instances.
- **High Availability:** Data must persist across server restarts or instance failures.
- **Large Data Sets:** Distributed caches can handle larger data volumes as the memory of a single server does not limit them.
- **Centralized Management:** Simplifies cache management by centralizing it rather than having separate caches on each server.

These benefits make distributed caching ideal for large-scale, high-availability applications deployed in load-balanced environments.

##### **Distributed Caching Techniques Supported by ASP.NET Core:**

ASP.NET Core supports multiple distributed caching solutions, including:

- **Redis:** A high-performance, open-source, in-memory key-value store often used as a distributed cache. It is widely popular due to its speed, scalability, and flexibility.
- **SQL Server:** SQL Server can store cache data in a relational database. Although it may not be as fast as Redis, it is suitable for environments already using SQL Server and provides easy integration with existing infrastructure.
- **NCache:** NCache is a native .NET distributed caching solution that integrates well with ASP.NET Core and offers high performance, scalability, and support for .NET features.
- **Memcached:** Memcached is a free, open-source, distributed memory caching system intended to speed up dynamic web applications and is also supported in ASP.NET Core.

##### **Caching Strategies in ASP.NET Core**

ASP.NET Core allows us to implement different caching strategies to fit our application’s needs. Some common strategies include:

- **Absolute Expiration:** The cache entry is set to expire at a specific point in time, regardless of how frequently it is accessed.
- **Sliding Expiration:** The cache entry’s lifetime is extended each time it is accessed. This strategy ensures that frequently accessed data remains in the cache.
- **Cache Dependencies:** Caching can depend on external events. For example, we can invalidate cache entries when a database record changes, ensuring that stale data is not served.
- **Manual Invalidation:** Developers explicitly remove or update cached data when changes occur.
- **Automatic Invalidation:** The cache system automatically handles invalidation based on predefined rules or triggers.

##### **Best Practices for Caching**

- **Cache Only Non-Sensitive Data:** Avoid caching sensitive information unless it’s properly secured.
- **Define Expiration Policies:** Ensure cached data expires appropriately.
- **Avoid Over-Caching:** Cache only what is necessary; excessive caching can waste resources.
- **Use Appropriate Cache Types:** Choose between in-memory and distributed caching based on your application needs.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Implement strategies to update or remove outdated cached data.
- **Monitor Cache Performance:** Monitor cache hit/miss ratios and adjust caching strategies accordingly.
- **Handle Cache Failures:** Ensure the application can function correctly even if the cache becomes unavailable.

Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API is essential for improving application performance and responsiveness. We can significantly reduce the number of backend requests by using caching techniques such as in-memory caching, distributed caching, or response caching, thereby decreasing server load and enhancing user experience. Choosing the appropriate caching strategy and type depends on the application’s requirements, scalability needs, and architecture.
