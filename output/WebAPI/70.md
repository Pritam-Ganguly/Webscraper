##### **What is In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core?**

In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core is a technique that temporarily stores frequently accessed data in the main memory (RAM) of the webserver to enable faster retrieval. In ASP.NET Core Web API, implementing in-memory caching can reduce the overhead of fetching data from slower sources such as databases or external APIs, significantly improving application performance. The following are the Key characteristics of In-Memory Caching:

- Data is stored as key-value pairs.
- It is server-specific and does not persist across application restarts.
- Useful for storing static or master data such as countries, states, and cities for faster retrieval.

##### **Example to Understand In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API**

In-memory caching is useful for scenarios where data changes infrequently, such as master data (e.g., countries, states, cities). By caching these data, we can minimize expensive database calls and improve the response time of our APIs. Let us proceed and see how to implement In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API Application.

##### **Set Up Your ASP.NET Core Web API Project**

To get started, open Visual Studio and create a new project. Select ASP.NET Core Web API as the project template and give the project name as **InMemoryCachingDemo**. Once you create the project, it should be created with the following structure.

![How to Implement In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22468%22%20height=%22252%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to Implement In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API")

##### **Add Necessary Packages:**

Since we will interact with a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core, add the necessary NuGet packages by running the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

- **Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer**
- **Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools**

##### **Define the Database Models**

In our example, we need to fetch the Country, State, and City master data, so we need three models. First, create a new folder named **Models**. Inside the Models folder, create three classes: Country, State, and City. Then, define the relationships using EF Core navigation properties.

###### **Country.cs**

```
namespace InMemoryCachingDemo.Models
{
    public class Country
    {
        public int CountryId { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public List<State> States { get; set; }
    }
}
```

###### **State.cs**

```
namespace InMemoryCachingDemo.Models
{
    public class State
    {
        public int StateId { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int CountryId { get; set; }
        public Country Country { get; set; }
        public List<City> Cities { get; set; }
    }
}
```

###### **City.cs**

```
namespace InMemoryCachingDemo.Models
{
    public class City
    {
        public int CityId { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int StateId { get; set; }
        public State State { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Create DbContext**

Create a new folder named **Data** and add a class named **ApplicationDbContext.cs** to manage entity configurations and database interaction. Here, we have also inserted some data using the HasData method by overriding the OnModelCreating method of the DbContext class. Once you create the class, copy and paste the following code.

```
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Models;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace InMemoryCachingDemo.Data
{
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
    {
        public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options)
        { }

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            // Seeding data for Countries
            modelBuilder.Entity<Country>().HasData(
                new Country { CountryId = 1, Name = "India" },
                new Country { CountryId = 2, Name = "United States" },
                new Country { CountryId = 3, Name = "Canada" },
                new Country { CountryId = 4, Name = "United Kingdom" }
            );

            // Seeding data for States
            modelBuilder.Entity<State>().HasData(
                new State { StateId = 1, Name = "California", CountryId = 2 },
                new State { StateId = 2, Name = "Texas", CountryId = 2 },
                new State { StateId = 3, Name = "British Columbia", CountryId = 3 },
                new State { StateId = 4, Name = "Ontario", CountryId = 3 },
                new State { StateId = 5, Name = "England", CountryId = 4 },
                new State { StateId = 6, Name = "Maharashtra", CountryId = 1 },
                new State { StateId = 7, Name = "Delhi", CountryId = 1 }
            );

            // Seeding data for Cities
            modelBuilder.Entity<City>().HasData(
                new City { CityId = 1, Name = "Los Angeles", StateId = 1 },
                new City { CityId = 2, Name = "San Francisco", StateId = 1 },
                new City { CityId = 3, Name = "Houston", StateId = 2 },
                new City { CityId = 4, Name = "Dallas", StateId = 2 },
                new City { CityId = 5, Name = "Vancouver", StateId = 3 },
                new City { CityId = 6, Name = "Toronto", StateId = 4 },
                new City { CityId = 7, Name = "London", StateId = 5 },
                new City { CityId = 8, Name = "Mumbai", StateId = 6 },
                new City { CityId = 9, Name = "Pune", StateId = 6 }
            );
        }

        public DbSet<Country> Countries { get; set; }
        public DbSet<State> States { get; set; }
        public DbSet<City> Cities { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Configure Connection String:**

Next, we need to add the SQL Server connection string to the appsettings.json file. So, modify the appsettings.json file as follows. Here, the EF Core will create the database LocationDB if it is not already created in the SQL server.

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=LAPTOP-6P5NK25R\\SQLSERVER2022DEV;Database=LocationDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

##### **Configure the DbContext in the Program.cs:**

Next, please modify the Program.cs class file as follows to register ApplicationDbContext and enable in-memory caching. This registers the memory caching services with the dependency injection (DI) container, allowing us to inject IMemoryCache into our classes.

```
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Data;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

namespace InMemoryCachingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            // Configure DbContext with SQL Server to the dependency injection (DI) container
            builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
                options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

            // Enable In-Memory Caching
            builder.Services.AddMemoryCache();

            // Add services to the container.
            builder.Services.AddControllers();
            // Learn more about configuring Swagger/OpenAPI at https://aka.ms/aspnetcore/swashbuckle
            builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
            builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

            var app = builder.Build();

            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.MapControllers();

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Create Database Migration:**

Open the Package Manager Console, execute the **Add-Migration** command to create the Migration, and then execute the **Update-Database** command to apply the migration to the database, as follows.

Once you execute the above command, it should the **LocationDB** database with the required database tables as shown in the below image:

![In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22332%22%20height=%22382%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core")

##### **How To Implement In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

In-memory caching in ASP.NET Core is implemented using the IMemoryCache interface. This interface provides a way to store key-value pairs in the web server’s main memory where the application is running, making them very fast to retrieve. The IMemoryCache interface provides methods to store, retrieve, and manage cached data in the server’s memory. It supports various caching strategies, including absolute expiration, sliding expiration, and cache priority.

- **Dependency Injection:** Inject IMemoryCache into services, repositories, or controllers.
- **Cache Methods:** Use Set, Get, TryGetValue, and Remove methods to manage cache entries.
- **Expiration Policies:** Define how long items should remain in the cache using absolute or sliding expiration.

##### **Create a Repository or Service:**

We need to inject the IMemoryCache interface into our service, repository, or controllers to use in-memory caching. To demonstrate in-memory caching, we will create a repository class. Create a folder named **Repository** and add a class named **LocationRepository.cs** within the Repository folder. Then, copy and paste the following code.

The following code is self-explained, so please read the comment lines for a better understanding. It shows how to combine database access and caching to enhance performance by reducing frequent database queries.

```
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Data;
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Models;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory;

namespace InMemoryCachingDemo.Repository
{
    public class LocationRepository
    {
        // ApplicationDbContext instance for interacting with the database.
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

        // IMemoryCache instance for implementing in-memory caching.
        private readonly IMemoryCache _cache;

        // Cache expiration time set to 30 minutes.
        private readonly TimeSpan _cacheExpiration = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);

        // Constructor to initialize the ApplicationDbContext and IMemoryCache.
        public LocationRepository(ApplicationDbContext context, IMemoryCache cache) 
        {
            _context = context; 
            _cache = cache; 
        }

        // Retrieves the list of countries, with caching.
        public async Task<List<Country>> GetCountriesAsync() 
        {
            // Defines a unique key for caching the countries data.
            var cacheKey = "Countries";

            // Checks if the countries data is already cached.
            if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out List<Country>? countries)) 
            {
                // If not cached, fetches the countries list from the database asynchronously.
                // AsNoTracking(): Improves performance for read-only queries by disabling change tracking.
                countries = await _context.Countries.AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();

                // Stores the fetched countries in the cache with the expiration time.
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, countries, _cacheExpiration); 
            }

            // Returns the cached or fetched countries, or an empty list if null.
            return countries ?? new List<Country>(); 
        }

        // Retrieves the list of states for a specific country, with caching.
        public async Task<List<State>> GetStatesAsync(int countryId) 
        {
            // Defines a unique cache key based on the country ID.
            string cacheKey = $"States_{countryId}";

            // Checks if the states data for the given country ID is cached.
            if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out List<State>? states)) 
            {
                // Fetches states from the database if not cached
                // AsNoTracking(): Improves performance for read-only queries by disabling change tracking.
                states = await _context.States.Where(s => s.CountryId == countryId).AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();

                // Stores the fetched states in the cache with the expiration time.
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, states, _cacheExpiration); 
            }

            // Returns the cached or fetched states, or an empty list if null.
            return states ?? new List<State>(); 
        }

        // Retrieves the list of cities for a specific state, with caching.
        public async Task<List<City>> GetCitiesAsync(int stateId) 
        {
            // Defines a unique cache key based on the state ID.
            string cacheKey = $"Cities_{stateId}";

            // Checks if the cities data for the given state ID is cached.
            if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out List<City>? cities)) 
            {
                // Fetches cities from the database if not cached.
                // AsNoTracking(): Improves performance for read-only queries by disabling change tracking.
                cities = await _context.Cities.Where(c => c.StateId == stateId).AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();

                // Stores the fetched cities in the cache with the expiration time.
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, cities, _cacheExpiration); 
            }

            // Returns the cached or fetched cities, or an empty list if null.
            return cities ?? new List<City>(); 
        }
    }
}
```

The above repository class uses an Entity Framework ApplicationDbContext and an ASP.NET Core IMemoryCache to cache and retrieve data for countries, states, and cities. It checks if data exists in the cache; if not, it retrieves it from the database and stores it in the cache with an expiration policy. We are using AsNoTracking() to improve performance for read-only queries by disabling change tracking.

##### **Register the Location Repository:**

Please add the following code to the Program.cs class file to register the LocationRepository in the dependency injection container so that we can inject the LocationRepository instance into the Controller and Services and use it.

**builder.Services.AddScoped<LocationRepository>();**

##### **Integration in the Controller**

Create an Empty API Controller named LocationController and then copy and paste the following code to handle requests. Here, we have created three action methods to access the Countries, States by Country ID, and Cities by State ID. The action method uses the Location Repository to fetch the data.

```
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Repository;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace InMemoryCachingDemo.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class LocationController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly LocationRepository _repository;

        public LocationController(LocationRepository repository)
        {
            _repository = repository;
        }

        // Retrieves all countries.
        [HttpGet("countries")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> GetCountries()
        {
            var countries = await _repository.GetCountriesAsync();
            return Ok(countries);
        }

        // Retrieves states by country ID.
        [HttpGet("states/{countryId}")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> GetStates(int countryId)
        {
            var states = await _repository.GetStatesAsync(countryId);
            return Ok(states);
        }

        // Retrieves cities by state ID.
        [HttpGet("cities/{stateId}")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> GetCities(int stateId)
        {
            var cities = await _repository.GetCitiesAsync(stateId);
            return Ok(cities);
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Test Your API:**

Use tools like Fiddler, Postman, or Swagger to test your API endpoints, and they should work as expected. You should observe that the first request will take more time as it has to fetch the data from the database. However, subsequent requests will fetch the data immediately as they will return the data from the cache instead of fetching it from the database.

##### **Cache Eviction Strategies in ASP.NET Core:**

To optimize cache usage, implementing different Cache Eviction Strategies is essential. Cache Eviction refers to the process of managing the lifecycle of cached data, ensuring that the data remains fresh and consistent with the underlying data source, such as a database. Implementing cache eviction allows us to update or invalidate cached data when the underlying data changes. ASP.NET Core supports several cache eviction or expiration settings:

- **Manual Eviction:** Manually remove the cache entry when the underlying data changes. This method is suitable for data that requires immediate consistency.
- **Sliding Expiration:** This method resets the expiration time whenever the cached item is accessed, ensuring that it only expires if it has not been accessed for a defined span of time. This approach is useful for data that should persist in the cache as long as it is frequently used. It keeps the frequently accessed data in the cache longer.
- **Absolute Expiration:** The cache entry will expire and be removed from the cache at a specific time. Whether the entry is accessed or not, it will expire after the set time. This ensures data is refreshed periodically.

##### **Example to Understand Cache Eviction Strategies in ASP.NET Core:**

Let’s implement the different cache eviction strategies in our example. We will implement the following eviction for different cache data:

- **Manual Eviction for Countries**
- **Sliding Expiration for States**
- **Absolute Expiration for Cities**

To implement Sliding Expiration and Absolute Expiration, we need to create an instance of the **MemoryCacheEntryOptions** class, set the Expiration accordingly, and pass this instance to the **Set** method of the Memory Cache. To implement Manual Eviction, we don’t need to pass any expiration time to the Set method.

For a better understanding, please modify the **LocationRepository** class as follows to Implement Different Expiration or Eviction Strategies. The following example code is self-explained. Please read the comment lines for a better understanding.

```
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Data;
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Models;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory;

namespace InMemoryCachingDemo.Repository
{
    public class LocationRepository
    {
        // ApplicationDbContext instance for interacting with the database.
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

        // IMemoryCache instance for implementing in-memory caching.
        private readonly IMemoryCache _cache;

        // Constructor to initialize the ApplicationDbContext and IMemoryCache.
        public LocationRepository(ApplicationDbContext context, IMemoryCache cache) 
        {
            _context = context; 
            _cache = cache; 
        }

        // Retrieves the list of countries, with caching.
        // Using Manual Eviction for countries
        public async Task<List<Country>> GetCountriesAsync() 
        {
            // Defines a unique key for caching the countries data.
            var cacheKey = "Countries";

            {
                // If not cached, fetches the countries list from the database asynchronously.
                countries = await _context.Countries.AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();

                // Stores the fetched countries in the cache without the expiration time.
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, countries);  // No Expiration Set 
            }

            // Returns the cached or fetched countries, or an empty list if null.
            return countries ?? new List<Country>(); 
        }

        // This Method can be called after updating or deleting country data.
        public void RemoveCountriesFromCache()
        {

        public async Task AddCountry(Country country)
        {
            _context.Countries.Add(country);
            await _context.SaveChangesAsync();

            //After adding, call the RemoveCountriesFromCache() method to clear the Country Cache
            RemoveCountriesFromCache();
        }

            RemoveCountriesFromCache();
        }

        // Retrieves the list of states for a specific country, with caching.

            if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out List<State>? states)) 
            {
                // Fetches states from the database if not cached
                states = await _context.States.Where(s => s.CountryId == countryId).AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();

                //Creating an instance of MemoryCacheEntryOptions
                var cacheEntryOptions = new MemoryCacheEntryOptions()
                    .SetSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30)); // Setting the Sliding Expiration

                // Stores the fetched states in the cache with the Sliding Expiration time.
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, states, cacheEntryOptions);
            }

            // Returns the cached or fetched states, or an empty list if null.
            return states ?? new List<State>(); 
        }

        // Retrieves the list of cities for a specific state, with caching.
        // Using Absolute Expiration for Cities
        public async Task<List<City>> GetCitiesAsync(int stateId) 
        {
            // Defines a unique cache key based on the state ID.
            string cacheKey = $"Cities_{stateId}";

            // Checks if the cities data for the given state ID is cached.
            if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out List<City>? cities)) 
            {
                // Fetches cities from the database if not cached.
                cities = await _context.Cities.Where(c => c.StateId == stateId).AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();

                //Creating an instance of MemoryCacheEntryOptions
                var cacheEntryOptions = new MemoryCacheEntryOptions()
                    .SetAbsoluteExpiration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30)); // Set the Absolute Expiration

                // Stores the fetched cities in the cache with the Absolute Expiration time.
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, cities, cacheEntryOptions);
            }

            // Returns the cached or fetched cities, or an empty list if null.
            return cities ?? new List<City>(); 
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Explanation:**

- **Manual Eviction for Countries:** Cache is cleared explicitly after add or updates to ensure data consistency.
- **Sliding Expiration for States:** Cache expiration resets after each access, keeping frequently accessed data in the cache.
- **Absolute Expiration for Cities:** Cache expires after a fixed duration, regardless of access frequency.

##### **Modifying Controller to Handle Cache Eviction**

The framework will handle absolute and Sliding Expiration automatically. We need to handle Manual Eviction explicitly in our code. That means when we add or update a country, we need to manually clear the Cache. Let us implement this by Modifying the LocationController as follows. Apart from the three existing endpoints, we have added two more endpoints to Add and Update the Country data.

```
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Models;
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Repository;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace InMemoryCachingDemo.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class LocationController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly LocationRepository _repository;

        public LocationController(LocationRepository repository)
        {
            _repository = repository;
        }

        // Retrieves all countries.
        [HttpGet("countries")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> GetCountries()
        {
            var countries = await _repository.GetCountriesAsync();
            return Ok(countries);
        }

        // Retrieves states by country ID.
        [HttpGet("states/{countryId}")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> GetStates(int countryId)
        {
            var states = await _repository.GetStatesAsync(countryId);
            return Ok(states);
        }

        // Retrieves cities by state ID.
        [HttpGet("cities/{stateId}")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> GetCities(int stateId)
        {
            var cities = await _repository.GetCitiesAsync(stateId);
            return Ok(cities);
        }

        //Add a New Country
        [HttpPost("countries")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> AddCountry(Country country)
        {
            try
            {
                await _repository.AddCountry(country);
                return Ok(); // Indicates success with No Data to Return
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                var customResponse = new
                {
                    Code = 500,
                    Message = "Internal Server Error",
                    // Do not expose the actual error to the client
                    ErrorMessage = ex.Message
                };
                return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError, customResponse);
            }
        }

        //Update Country By Id
        [HttpPut("countries/{id}")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> UpdateCountry(int id, Country country)
        {
            if (id != country.CountryId)
            {
                return BadRequest();
            }
            
            try
            {
                await _repository.UpdateCountry(country);
                return Ok(); // Indicates success with No Data to Return
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                if (!CountryExists(id))
                {
                    return NotFound("Country Does Not Exists");
                }  
                else
                {
                    var customResponse = new
                    {
                        Code = 500,
                        Message = "Internal Server Error",
                        // Do not expose the actual error to the client
                        ErrorMessage = ex.Message
                    };
                    return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError, customResponse);
                }
            }
        }

        private bool CountryExists(int id)
        {
            return _repository.GetCountriesAsync().Result.Any(e => e.CountryId == id);
        }
    }
}
```

Now, run the application and test the endpoints; it should work as expected.

##### **In-Memory Cache Priority in ASP.NET Core:**

Cache Priority in ASP.NET Core determines how likely a cache entry is to be removed when the system needs to free up memory or under memory pressure. Managing cache priorities ensures that critical data remains cached longer while less important data can be evicted under memory pressure.

Entries can be tagged as Low, Normal, High, or NeverRemove. When memory pressure occurs, entries with lower priorities are removed first. .NET provides several levels of cache item priority. They are as follows:

- Low: Items that can be discarded easily.
- Normal: The default priority if none is specified.
- High: Items that should be retained longer.
- NeverRemove: Items that should never be automatically removed due to memory pressure (though you can still manually remove them).

##### **Example to Understand Cache Priority in ASP.NET Core Web API:**

In our LocationRepository, let us set the cache priorities as follows:

- **Countries: High priority.**
- **States: Normal priority.**
- **Cities: Low priority.**

We need to use the SetPriority method of the MemoryCacheEntryOptions class to set the Cache Priority. To this SetPriority method, we need to pass the Cache Priority by using the CacheItemPriority Enum. And finally, we need to pass the MemoryCacheEntryOptions instance to the Set method of the Memory cache. So, for a better understanding, please modify the LocationRepository class as follows:

```
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Data;
using InMemoryCachingDemo.Models;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory;

namespace InMemoryCachingDemo.Repository
{
    public class LocationRepository
    {
        // ApplicationDbContext instance for interacting with the database.
        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context;

        // IMemoryCache instance for implementing in-memory caching.
        private readonly IMemoryCache _cache;

        // Constructor to initialize the ApplicationDbContext and IMemoryCache.
        public LocationRepository(ApplicationDbContext context, IMemoryCache cache) 
        {
            _context = context; 
            _cache = cache; 
        }

        // Retrieves the list of countries, with caching.
        // Using Manual Eviction for countries with High Priority
        public async Task<List<Country>> GetCountriesAsync() 
        {
            // Defines a unique key for caching the countries data.
            var cacheKey = "Countries";

            // Checks if the countries data is already cached.
            if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out List<Country>? countries)) 
            {
                // If not cached, fetches the countries list from the database asynchronously.
                countries = await _context.Countries.AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();

                // No Expiration Set
                var cacheEntryOptions = new MemoryCacheEntryOptions()
                    .SetPriority(CacheItemPriority.High); // High priority for countries

                // Stores the fetched countries in the cache without the expiration time but with High Priority.
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, countries, cacheEntryOptions);
            }

            // Returns the cached or fetched countries, or an empty list if null.
            return countries ?? new List<Country>(); 
        }

        // This Method can be called after updating or deleting country data.
        public void RemoveCountriesFromCache()
        {
            var cacheKey = "Countries";
            _cache.Remove(cacheKey);
        }

        //This method is used to add a Country
        public async Task AddCountry(Country country)
        {
            _context.Countries.Add(country);
            await _context.SaveChangesAsync();

            //After adding, call the RemoveCountriesFromCache() method to clear the Country Cache
            RemoveCountriesFromCache();
        }

        // This method is used to Update a Country
        public async Task UpdateCountry(Country updatedCountry)
        {
            _context.Countries.Update(updatedCountry);
            await _context.SaveChangesAsync();

            //After updating, call the RemoveCountriesFromCache() method to clear the Country Cache
            RemoveCountriesFromCache();
        }

        // Retrieves the list of states for a specific country, with caching.
        // Using Sliding Expiration for states
        public async Task<List<State>> GetStatesAsync(int countryId) 
        {
            // Defines a unique cache key based on the country ID.
            string cacheKey = $"States_{countryId}";

            // Checks if the states data for the given country ID is cached.
            if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out List<State>? states)) 
            {
                // Fetches states from the database if not cached
                states = await _context.States.Where(s => s.CountryId == countryId).AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();

                var cacheEntryOptions = new MemoryCacheEntryOptions()
                    .SetSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30)) // Setting the Sliding Expiration
                    .SetPriority(CacheItemPriority.Normal); // Normal priority for states

                // Stores the fetched states in the cache with the Sliding Expiration and Normal Priority.
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, states, cacheEntryOptions);
            }

            // Returns the cached or fetched states, or an empty list if null.
            return states ?? new List<State>(); 
        }

        // Retrieves the list of cities for a specific state, with caching.
        // Using Absolute Expiration for Cities
        public async Task<List<City>> GetCitiesAsync(int stateId) 
        {
            // Defines a unique cache key based on the state ID.
            string cacheKey = $"Cities_{stateId}";

            // Checks if the cities data for the given state ID is cached.
            if (!_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out List<City>? cities)) 
            {
                // Fetches cities from the database if not cached.
                cities = await _context.Cities.Where(c => c.StateId == stateId).AsNoTracking().ToListAsync();

                var cacheEntryOptions = new MemoryCacheEntryOptions()
                    .SetAbsoluteExpiration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30)) // Set the Absolute Expiration
                    .SetPriority(CacheItemPriority.Low); // Low priority for cities
                                
                // Stores the fetched cities in the cache with the Absolute Expiration and Low priority.
                _cache.Set(cacheKey, cities, cacheEntryOptions);
            }

            // Returns the cached or fetched cities, or an empty list if null.
            return cities ?? new List<City>(); 
        }
    }
}
```

##### **When to Use In-Memory Caching?**

In-memory caching is appropriate in scenarios where:

- The application is hosted on a single server.
- The cached data is small and fits comfortably in available memory.
- Data doesn’t need to persist beyond the application lifecycle.

In the next article, I will discuss [**Extending the In-Memory Cache in an ASP.NET Core Web API**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/how-to-create-custom-in-memory-cache-in-asp-net-core-web-api/) Application with Examples. In this article, I explain How to Implement In-Memory Caching in ASP.NET Core Web API application with Examples.
