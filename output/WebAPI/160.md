Please read our previous article discussing Top 50 [**ASP.NET Core Web API Basic Interview Questions and Answers**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/asp-net-core-web-api-basic-interview-questions-and-answers/). Here’s a comprehensive list of ASP.NET Core Web API Intermediate Interview Questions and Answers.

##### **How does dependency injection work in ASP.NET Core Web API, and why is it important?**

Dependency Injection (DI) in ASP.NET Core is implemented via the built-in IoC (Inversion of Control) container. This container manages the instantiation and lifetime of application components. When a component requires a dependency, the container provides it. This promotes loose coupling between components, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable. ASP.NET Core primarily uses constructor injection, where dependencies are provided through a class’s constructor. This approach makes dependencies explicit and facilitates easy unit testing by allowing mock implementations to be injected.

##### **Explain the differences between Singleton, Scoped, and Transient lifetimes in ASP.NET Core Web API.**

- **Singleton:** Objects registered as singletons are created once and shared throughout the application’s lifetime. This is useful for stateless services or objects that are expensive to create and can be reused across requests.
- **Scoped:** Scoped objects are created once per client request within the scope of that request. They are disposed of when the request ends. Scoped lifetime is beneficial for objects that maintain state specific to a single request, such as database contexts or unit of work instances.
- **Transient:** Transient objects are created every time they are requested. They are not shared between requests or other components. Transient lifetime is suitable for lightweight, stateless services where a new instance is needed for each operation.

##### **Describe the process of creating and consuming custom Middleware in ASP.NET Core Web API.**

Middleware in ASP.NET Core is software components that are assembled into the request pipeline to handle requests and responses. Custom Middleware allows developers to inject custom logic into the pipeline to perform tasks such as authentication, logging, or error handling. To create custom Middleware, you typically implement the IMiddleware interface or create a function that accepts a RequestDelegate. The Middleware’s Invoke method is where the logic is executed. To consume custom Middleware, you add it to the request pipeline using the UseMiddleware<T>() extension method within the Configure method of the Startup class.

##### **What is Entity Framework Core, and what are its advantages over ADO.NET Core?**

Entity Framework Core (EF Core): EF Core is an ORM framework provided by Microsoft for .NET applications. It simplifies data access by allowing developers to work with database objects as .NET objects. Advantages include increased productivity due to automatic code generation, LINQ support for querying databases, and built-in support for change tracking and database migrations.

ADO.NET: ADO.NET is a set of .NET libraries for accessing data from various data sources, including relational databases. While ADO.NET provides greater control over data access operations, it requires writing more code for common tasks like mapping database results to objects and managing connections, commands, and transactions manually.

##### **How do you implement unit testing in ASP.NET Core Web API applications?**

Unit testing in ASP.NET Core Web API involves testing individual units of code in isolation to ensure they behave as expected. This typically includes testing controllers, services, repositories, and other components. Frameworks like MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit can be used for writing unit tests. Mocking frameworks such as Moq or NSubstitute are often employed to isolate dependencies and simulate behavior. Tests should cover various scenarios, including input validation, business logic, error handling, and integration with external dependencies.

##### **What is the Repository Pattern, and how does it apply to ASP.NET Core Web API?**

The Repository pattern is a design pattern that abstracts the data access logic from the rest of the application. In ASP.NET Core Web API, repositories encapsulate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for entities, providing a clean separation between the business logic and data access code. Repositories typically expose methods for querying and manipulating data, allowing the rest of the application to interact with the data store through a consistent interface. This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and testability.

##### **Explain the Unit of Work pattern and its benefits in ASP.NET Core Web API applications.**

The Unit of Work pattern is a design pattern used to manage transactions and ensure data consistency within an application. In ASP.NET Core Web API, the Unit of Work pattern coordinates multiple repository operations within a single transaction. This ensures that either all operations are successfully committed to the database or none of them are. By grouping related database operations into a single unit of work, the pattern helps maintain data integrity and consistency, even in complex scenarios involving multiple data manipulation operations.

##### **Describe the Process and Benefits of API Versioning in ASP.NET Core Web API.**

API versioning is the practice of managing changes to a Web API’s interface over time while ensuring backward compatibility with existing clients. In ASP.NET Core Web API, versioning can be achieved through various mechanisms, including URL-based versioning, query string-based versioning, header-based versioning, or media type-based versioning. Versioning allows API developers to introduce breaking changes without disrupting existing clients, support multiple versions of the API concurrently, and improve API discoverability by signaling the API version in requests.

##### **What are Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), and why are they used in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are objects used to transfer data between the client and server in a Web API. DTOs typically represent a subset of data from one or more domain models and are optimized for network transmission. In ASP.NET Core Web API, DTOs are used to decouple the API from the underlying data model, providing flexibility in data representation and allowing the API to evolve independently of the database schema. By reducing the amount of data transferred over the network and simplifying the data structure, DTOs improve the performance and maintainability of the API.

##### **How do you secure an ASP.NET Core Web API using JWT Authentication?**

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication is a popular method for securing ASP.NET Core Web APIs. Here’s how it’s typically implemented:

- Install the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer NuGet package.
- Configure JWT authentication using the ConfigureServices method of the Startup class using AddAuthentication and AddJwtBearer methods.
- Specify options such as the issuer, audience, and signing key for token validation.
- Add the authentication middleware to the request pipeline using UseAuthentication in the Configure method of the Startup class.
- Use the [Authorize] attribute on controllers or actions that require authentication.
- Generate JWT tokens during user authentication and include them in the Authorization header of subsequent requests.

##### **Explain the difference between Razor Pages and MVC and Web API in ASP.NET Core.**

- **Razor Pages:** Introduced in ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages is a lightweight alternative to the MVC pattern for building web applications. It emphasizes convention over configuration and allows developers to build UI-focused applications with less ceremony compared to MVC.
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** MVC is a design pattern for building web applications that separates the application into three main components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic). ASP.NET Core MVC provides robust support for building full-featured web applications.
- **Web API:** ASP.NET Core Web API is a framework for building HTTP services that can be consumed by a variety of clients, including web applications, mobile apps, and IoT devices. It’s optimized for RESTful communication and typically returns data in JSON or XML format.

##### **What is CORS, and how is it configured in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from scripts. In ASP.NET Core Web API, CORS policies can be configured using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors package. Configuration involves adding CORS services in the ConfigureServices method of the Startup class and specifying CORS policies using the AddCors method. CORS policies can be applied globally to all controllers or selectively to specific controllers or actions using the [EnableCors] attribute.

##### **How do you implement custom validation in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Custom validation in ASP.NET Core Web API can be achieved by implementing custom validation attributes or by creating custom validation logic within action methods or service classes. To create custom validation attributes, derive from the ValidationAttribute class and override the IsValid method to perform validation logic. Custom validation logic can also be implemented by injecting the ModelState object into action methods and manually adding validation errors using the ModelState.AddModelError method.

##### **What is SignalR, and how can it be used in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

SignalR is a library in ASP.NET Core that adds real-time web functionality to applications. It enables bi-directional communication between the server and client over a single, long-lived connection. SignalR can be used in ASP.NET Core Web API to implement real-time features such as chat applications, live updates, and notifications. To use SignalR, install the Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR package, define Hub classes to handle client-server communication and configure SignalR middleware in the Startup class.

##### **How do you perform file uploads in ASP.NET Core Web APIs?**

File uploads in ASP.NET Core Web APIs can be implemented using the IFormFile interface provided by ASP.NET Core. Here’s a basic approach:

- Use a multipart/form-data form to upload files from the client.
- Define action methods in the controller to handle file uploads, accepting IFormFile parameters.
- Read the file contents using the OpenReadStream method of the IFormFile interface.
- Process the uploaded file as needed, such as saving it to disk or storing it in a database.

##### **Explain the Role of Action Filters in ASP.NET Core Web API.**

Action Filters in ASP.NET Core Web API are attributes that can be applied to controller actions to perform cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authorization, caching, validation, and exception handling. Action Filters allow developers to encapsulate common logic that needs to be executed before or after an action method is invoked. ASP.NET Core provides several built-in action filters, such as [Authorize] for authorization, [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] for preventing CSRF attacks, and [ResponseCache] for caching responses.

##### **How do you optimize the performance of ASP.NET Core Web API applications?**

Performance optimization in ASP.NET Core Web API applications involves various techniques such as:

- Implementing caching to reduce database and network overhead.
- Enabling compression to reduce payload size and improve response times.
- Minimizing unnecessary data transfer by using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and selective field projection.
- Optimizing database queries by indexing frequently accessed columns and using asynchronous database operations.
- Distributed caching and load balancing are used for scalability and fault tolerance.
- Monitoring application performance using tools like Application Insights or Serilog.

##### **What is Response Caching, and how do you implement it in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Response caching in ASP.NET Core Web API allows you to cache the output of HTTP responses to improve performance and reduce server load. Response caching can be configured at the action level using attributes like [ResponseCache] or globally in the Main method of the Program class. Configuration options include cache duration, cache location (client-side or server-side), cache key settings, and cache profiles. Response caching can significantly reduce response times for frequently accessed endpoints and improve the scalability of the application.

##### **How does the ASP.NET Core Web API Routing Engine Work?**

The ASP.NET Core Web API Routing engine is responsible for mapping incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller action methods based on the URL pattern defined in the route templates. It follows a convention-based approach where routes are defined in the Program.cs file using the MapControllerRoute or MapGet, MapPost, etc., methods provided by the routing middleware.

When a request is received, the routing engine matches the URL pattern to the route template of registered routes. If a match is found, it invokes the corresponding controller action method. If no match is found, it returns a 404 Not Found response.

Route parameters can be specified within curly braces {} in the route template, allowing for dynamic routing. Additionally, attribute routing can be used to define routes directly on controller action methods or controllers themselves, providing more control over the routing behavior.

##### **Describe how to implement global exception handling in ASP.NET Core Web API.**

Global exception handling in ASP.NET Core Web API involves intercepting unhandled exceptions that occur during request processing and providing a centralized mechanism to handle them. This can be achieved by implementing a custom middleware or by using the built-in exception handling middleware provided by ASP.NET Core.

To implement global exception handling:

- Create a custom middleware component that intercepts exceptions in the request pipeline.
- Configure the middleware in the Configure method of the Startup class.
- Inside the middleware, handle exceptions by logging them, customizing the response, and returning appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Optionally, configure the middleware to return detailed error messages in development mode and generic error messages in production mode.

##### **What is the purpose of appsettings.json in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

The appsettings.json file in ASP.NET Core Web API is used to store configuration settings for the application. It follows the JSON format and allows developers to define key-value pairs for various settings such as connection strings, logging configuration, authentication settings, and application-specific configurations.

The purpose of appsettings.json is to provide a centralized location for configuring application settings, which can be easily accessed and modified without modifying the source code. Additionally, ASP.NET Core supports hierarchical configuration, allowing settings to be overridden at different levels (e.g., development, staging, production) through environment-specific configuration files.

##### **What are the best practices for logging in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

- **Use built-in logging providers:** ASP.NET Core provides built-in logging abstractions that support various logging providers such as Console, Debug, EventSource, EventLog, Serilog, etc.
- **Configure logging levels**: Use different log levels (e.g., Information, Warning, Error) to categorize log messages based on their severity.
- **Use structured logging:** Log messages in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate analysis and filtering.
- **Log relevant information:** Include relevant information in log messages, such as request details, user context, timestamps, and exception stack traces.
- **Implement log filtering and enrichment:** Use middleware or custom logging components to filter and enrich log messages with additional context information.
- **Secure sensitive information:** Avoid logging sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data.

##### **How do you implement OAuth2 and OpenID Connect in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are industry-standard protocols used for authentication and authorization in modern web applications. In ASP.NET Core Web API, you can implement OAuth2 and OpenID Connect using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication middleware and external authentication providers such as IdentityServer4, Okta, or Azure AD.

To implement OAuth2 and OpenID Connect:

- Install the required NuGet packages for authentication middleware and provider-specific libraries.
- Configure authentication middleware in the Startup.cs file to use OAuth2 or OpenID Connect as the authentication scheme.
- Configure authentication options such as client ID, client secret, scopes, callback URLs, etc.
- Implement callback endpoints to handle authentication callbacks and exchange tokens.
- Use authorization attributes to restrict access to protected resources based on OAuth2 scopes or roles.

##### **Describe the process of implementing API rate limiting in ASP.NET Core Web API.**

API rate limiting is a technique used to control the number of requests that clients can make to an API within a specific time period. In ASP.NET Core Web API, you can implement API rate limiting using middleware such as AspNetCoreRateLimit.

To implement API rate limiting:

- Install the AspNetCoreRateLimit NuGet package.
- Configure rate-limiting options such as rate limits, IP address tracking, client identification, etc., in the Startup.cs file.
- Add rate limiting middleware to the request pipeline with appropriate configuration.
- Handle rate limit-exceeded errors and provide appropriate responses to clients.
- Optionally, persist rate limit counters to a distributed cache or database for scalability and reliability.

##### **What is Swagger, and how do you integrate it into an ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Swagger is an open-source framework for documenting and testing APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows developers to explore API endpoints, view request and response schemas, and execute API requests directly from the browser.

To integrate Swagger into an ASP.NET Core Web API:

- Install the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore NuGet package.
- Configure Swagger services in the Startup.cs file using the AddSwaggerGen method.
- Customize Swagger documentation using attributes and fluent API options.
- Enable Swagger UI and Swagger JSON endpoints in the request pipeline.
- Optionally, secure Swagger endpoints with authentication and authorization middleware to restrict access.

##### **How do you use attribute routing in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Attribute routing allows developers to define routes directly on controller action methods or controllers themselves using attributes. This provides a more declarative and concise way to define routes compared to convention-based routing.

To use attribute routing in ASP.NET Core Web API:

- Decorate controller classes or action methods with the [Route] attribute to specify route templates.
- Optionally, use route parameters within curly braces {} to define dynamic segments of the route.
- Define multiple routes for a single action method using the [HttpGet], [HttpPost], etc., attributes with different route templates.
- Customize route constraints using built-in constraint attributes or by implementing custom route constraint classes.

##### **Explain how to serialize and deserialize JSON in ASP.NET Core Web API**

ASP.NET Core Web API uses Newtonsoft.Json (or System.Text.Json) for JSON serialization and deserialization. These libraries automatically serialize and deserialize .NET objects to and from JSON format.

To serialize JSON:

- Return .NET objects from controller action methods. ASP.NET Core automatically serializes them to JSON.
- Customize serialization behavior using attributes such as [JsonProperty] to control property names or [JsonIgnore] to exclude properties from serialization.

To deserialize JSON:

- Accept JSON data in controller action method parameters. ASP.NET Core automatically binds JSON data to .NET objects.
- Use model binding to bind JSON data to complex objects from HTTP request bodies.
- Validate and handle deserialization errors using model validation attributes or manually parsing JSON data using libraries like Newtonsoft.Json.

##### **How do you handle multiple environments (development, staging, production) in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for managing multiple environments such as development, staging, and production. This is achieved by utilizing environment-specific configuration files (appsettings.{Environment}.json) and environment variables.

- **Configuration files:** ASP.NET Core loads configuration settings from appsettings.json by default. To override settings for specific environments, you can create environment-specific configuration files like appsettings.Development.json, appsettings.Staging.json, and appsettings.Production.json. These files contain settings specific to each environment and override the base settings defined in appsettings.json.
- **Environment variables:** Environment variables provide another way to configure settings for different environments. ASP.NET Core automatically maps environment variables with names matching configuration keys to override settings from configuration files. For example, setting ASPNETCORE\_ENVIRONMENT=Production as an environment variable will change the environment to production mode.

##### **What is the IHttpClientFactory, and why should you use it in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

IHttpClientFactory is a feature introduced in ASP.NET Core to manage and reuse HttpClient instances efficiently. In traditional usage, creating new HttpClient instances for each request can lead to performance issues due to socket exhaustion. IHttpClientFactory addresses this by managing the lifecycle of HttpClient instances and providing features such as automatic handling of DNS changes, automatic retries, and dependency injection integration.

Benefits of using IHttpClientFactory:

- **Reduced resource consumption:** It reuses HttpClient instances, leading to better resource utilization.
- **Improved performance:** It optimizes HttpClient usage and reduces overhead associated with creating and disposing of HttpClient instances.
- **Simplified HttpClient management:** It centralizes HttpClient configuration and management, making it easier to configure and customize HttpClient instances.

##### **How do you configure and use dependency injection in a class library in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

To configure dependency injection (DI) in a class library for use in ASP.NET Core Web API, follow these steps:

- Define interfaces for services within the class library.
- Implement concrete service classes that implement these interfaces.
- Register services and their corresponding implementations in the DI container during application startup. This can be done in the Main method of the Program class by calling services.AddScoped, services.AddTransient, or services.AddSingleton, depending on the desired service lifetime.
- Optionally, use service lifetimes appropriate for the application’s needs (e.g., transient, scoped, or singleton) to control the lifetime of service instances.

##### **How do you implement background tasks in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Background tasks in ASP.NET Core Web API can be implemented using hosted services. Hosted services are long-running background tasks managed by the ASP.NET Core runtime. They run independently of any incoming HTTP requests and can perform tasks such as background processing, periodic tasks, or event-driven processing.

To implement a background task:

- Create a class that implements the IHostedService interface.
- Implement the StartAsync and StopAsync methods to start and stop the background task.
- Register the hosted service in the DI container during application startup.
- ASP.NET Core automatically starts the hosted service when the application starts and stops it when the application shuts down.

##### **Describe how to use the options pattern for configuration in ASP.NET Core Web API.**

The options pattern in ASP.NET Core simplifies configuration management by providing a way to map configuration settings from various sources (e.g., JSON files, environment variables) to strongly typed classes. This pattern is especially useful for organizing and accessing configuration settings in a type-safe manner.

To use the options pattern:

- Define a class to represent the configuration settings.
- Configure the settings class using the Configure<TOptions> method in the ConfigureServices method of the Startup class.
- Access the configured settings using dependency injection by injecting an instance of the settings class where needed.
- The options pattern improves maintainability by centralizing configuration logic and provides compile-time safety by leveraging the C# type system.

##### **How do you manage user sessions in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

ASP.NET Core Web API is stateless by default, meaning it does not maintain user sessions between requests. However, you can implement session management using various techniques:

- **Token-based authentication:** Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth2 tokens for authentication and authorization. Tokens are self-contained and can store user identity and other relevant information.
- **Distributed caching:** Store session data in a distributed cache such as Redis or SQL Server. This allows session data to be shared across multiple servers in a web farm.
- **Cookie-based authentication:** Store session identifiers in encrypted cookies. ASP.NET Core provides built-in support for cookie authentication, which can be used to maintain user sessions.

##### **What are environment variables, and how do you use them in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Environment variables are dynamic variables that are part of the environment in which a process runs. In ASP.NET Core Web API, environment variables are commonly used for configuration and environment-specific settings. They provide a way to override default configuration settings and customize application behavior based on the execution environment (e.g., development, staging, production).

To use environment variables in ASP.NET Core Web API:

- Define environment-specific configuration settings in appsettings.json or other configuration sources.
- Optionally, provide default values for configuration settings.
- Configure environment variables with names matching configuration keys to override settings from configuration files.
- Access configuration settings using the IConfiguration interface or the options pattern.
- Set environment variables using operating system-specific commands or tools provided by cloud platforms (e.g., Azure App Configuration).

##### **Explain how to implement localization in ASP.NET Core Web API.**

Localization in ASP.NET Core Web API allows you to provide multi-language support for your API responses. To implement localization:

- Define resource files (.resx) for each supported language containing key-value pairs of translated strings.
- Configure localization services in the Startup.cs file using the AddLocalization method.
- Add middleware to the request pipeline to enable localization and set the current culture based on the request’s language header or query string.
- Use localization helpers such as IStringLocalizer or IViewLocalizer to localize strings in controller actions or views.

##### **How do you configure HTTPS in ASP.NET Core Web API**

To configure HTTPS in ASP.NET Core Web API:

- Install an SSL certificate on your web server or use development certificates provided by tools like IIS Express or Kestrel.
- Configure Kestrel or IIS to listen for HTTPS requests in the Program.cs or Startup.cs file respectively.
- Use the UseHttpsRedirection middleware to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- Optionally, configure HTTPS settings such as SSL certificate paths, protocols, and port numbers in the appsettings.json file.

##### **What is the difference between AddMvc() and AddMvcCore() methods in Program.cs?**

- **AddMvc():** This method adds full MVC services to the application, including support for features like Razor views, model binding, filters, etc. It registers all the necessary services required for MVC-based development.
- **AddMvcCore():** This method adds only the core MVC services to the application without including features like Razor views or certain conventions. It provides a lighter-weight alternative for scenarios where full MVC functionality is not required, such as API-only applications or minimalistic web applications.

##### **How do you implement health checks in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Health checks in ASP.NET Core Web API allow you to monitor the health of your application and its dependencies. To implement health checks:

- Ensure that the application pool identity has appropriate permissions to access the application files and resources.
- Optionally, configure additional settings such as HTTPS bindings, URL rewrite rules, or application pool settings.

##### **How do you manage configuration settings in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Configuration settings in ASP.NET Core Web API are typically managed using the appsettings.json file, environment-specific configuration files, environment variables, or Azure Key Vault. To manage configuration settings:

- Define configuration settings in the appsettings.json file using JSON syntax.
- Optionally, define environment-specific configuration files such as appsettings.Development.json or appsettings.Production.json.
- Use the ConfigurationBuilder to load configuration settings from various sources and build a configuration object in the Startup.cs file.
- Access configuration settings using the IConfiguration interface in controllers, services, or middleware components.

##### **Explain the concept of middleware in the ASP.NET Core Web API request processing pipeline.**

Middleware in ASP.NET Core Web API is software components that are executed in the request processing pipeline to handle requests and responses. Middleware can perform tasks such as request routing, authentication, authorization, logging, error handling, compression, and more. Middleware components are added to the request pipeline in the Main method of the Program.cs file using the Use extension methods provided by the IApplicationBuilder interface.

##### **What is the purpose of the launchSettings.json file in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

The launchSettings.json file in ASP.NET Core Web API is used to configure settings for launching the application in various environments such as development, staging, or production. It defines profiles for different launch environments, including settings such as application URLs, environment variables, command-line arguments, and debugger options. The purpose of the launchSettings.json file is to provide a centralized location for configuring launch settings that can be easily shared across development teams and development environments.

##### **How do you implement social login (e.g., Google, Facebook) in ASP.NET Core Web API?**
