##### **Describe HTTP methods and their purpose.**

HTTP methods, also known as HTTP verbs, are actions that can be performed on a resource. The main HTTP methods and their purposes are:

- **GET:** Retrieve data from the server.
- **POST:** Submit data to the server to create a new resource.
- **PUT:** Update an existing resource on the server.
- **DELETE:** Remove a resource from the server.
- **PATCH:** Apply partial modifications to a resource.
- **OPTIONS:** Retrieve information about the communication options available for a resource.
- **HEAD:** Retrieve metadata about a resource without fetching the resource itself.

##### **What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Middleware in ASP.NET Core Web API is software components that are added to the HTTP request pipeline to handle requests and responses. Middleware components are executed in the order they are added to the pipeline and can perform various tasks such as logging, authentication, authorization, exception handling, and content negotiation.

##### **Explain routing in ASP.NET Core Web API.**

Routing in ASP.NET Core Web API is the process of matching incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controller action based on the request URL and HTTP method. Route templates are defined using attributes or convention-based routing, allowing developers to define custom URL patterns for their APIs.

- Promotes the principle of “Inversion of Control” (IoC), where the control of object creation and lifecycle management is delegated to a container.

##### **How do you handle errors in ASP.NET Core Web APIs?**

Errors in ASP.NET Core Web APIs can be handled using various techniques such as:

- **Global exception handling:** Implementing a global exception filter to catch unhandled exceptions and return appropriate error responses.
- **Middleware:** Writing custom middleware components to handle specific types of errors and generate error responses.
- **Use of status codes:** Returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error) to indicate the nature of the error.
- **Logging:** Logging errors and exceptions to record details for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.
- **Error response models:** Creating custom error response models to provide additional information about the error to the client.

##### **Explain data annotation in ASP.NET Core Web API.**

Data annotations in ASP.NET Core Web API are attributes that can be applied to model properties to specify validation rules, formatting options, and other metadata. Examples of data annotations include [Required], [StringLength], [Range], [RegularExpression], etc. These annotations help in validating and formatting data before it is processed by the API.

##### **How do you perform database migrations in EF Core?**

Database migrations in EF Core can be performed using the Entity Framework Core Migrations feature. Developers can use the dotnet ef migrations CLI commands or the Add-Migration and Update-Database commands in the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio to create and apply migrations to the database schema based on changes made to the model classes.

##### **What are action filters?**

Action filters in ASP.NET Core Web API are attributes that can be applied to controller actions to add pre-processing or post-processing logic. They allow developers to intercept requests before they reach the controller action or responses before they are sent back to the client. Examples of action filters include AuthorizationFilter, ExceptionFilter, ActionFilter, and ResultFilter.

##### **How do you log information in ASP.NET Core Web API applications?**

Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API applications can be done using the built-in logging framework provided by Microsoft.Extensions.Logging namespace. Developers can configure logging providers such as Console, Debug, EventLog, File, etc., in the ConfigureLogging method of Startup class. Logging can be done using the ILogger interface, which allows logging of messages at different log levels such as Information, Warning, Error, Debug, etc.

##### **What is CORS, and how do you enable it?**

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that restricts web applications running on one domain from making requests to another domain. In ASP.NET Core Web API, CORS can be enabled by configuring CORS policies in the ConfigureServices method of the Startup class using the AddCors method. CORS policies can be configured to allow or restrict cross-origin requests based on specified origins, HTTP methods, headers, etc.

Program.cs is the entry point of an ASP.NET Core Web API application. It contains the Main method, which sets up the host for the application and configures services and middleware. It is responsible for configuring the application’s host, logging, dependency injection, and starting the web server.

##### **How do you create and use custom middleware in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Custom middleware in ASP.NET Core Web API can be created by implementing a class with a method that conforms to the RequestDelegate delegate signature. The custom middleware can perform tasks such as request processing, response modification, error handling, etc. It is added to the middleware pipeline using the UseMiddleware extension method in the Configure method of the Startup class.

##### **What are the differences between app.Use vs. app.Run?**

- **app.Use:** Adds middleware to the request processing pipeline. It can handle the request itself or pass it to the next middleware in the pipeline.
- **app.Run:** Adds terminal middleware to the request processing pipeline. It must be the last middleware added and is responsible for generating a response or terminating the request pipeline.

##### **How do you handle file uploads in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

File uploads in ASP.NET Core Web API can be handled by using the IFormFile interface to represent uploaded files in controller action parameters. The files can be received as part of a multipart/form-data request and processed using model binding or directly accessing the request body. Additionally, developers can configure the maximum file size and other upload-related settings in the Startup class.

##### **How do you implement authentication using Identity in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Authentication using Identity in ASP.NET Core Web API can be implemented by configuring the Identity services in the ConfigureServices method of the Startup class. This involves setting up identity options, specifying the user and role entity types, configuring authentication schemes, and enabling authentication middleware.

- Utilizing CDN (Content Delivery Network) to serve static content.
- Profiling and performance testing to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

##### **What is the difference between AddMvc() and AddMvcCore()?**

- **AddMvc():** This method adds all the necessary services for MVC (Model-View-Controller), including filters, formatters, model binders, and view engines. It configures MVC options and adds all built-in MVC services required for full MVC functionality.
- **AddMvcCore():** This method adds only the minimal set of services required for MVC, excluding features like Razor view engine, model validation, and other higher-level MVC functionalities. It is suitable for building lightweight APIs without the overhead of full MVC.

##### **How do you manage sessions in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

ASP.NET Core Web API typically does not use session state because it’s designed for stateless communication. However, if session management is required, developers can use distributed caching or session management middleware provided by ASP.NET Core. This involves configuring session services in the Startup class and using the HttpContext.Session property to access and manipulate session data.

##### **What are dependency injection scopes?**

Dependency injection scopes in ASP.NET Core Web API define the lifespan of a service instance created by the dependency injection container. There are three built-in scopes:

- **Transient:** A new instance of the service is created every time it is requested.
- **Scoped:** A single instance of the service is created per request scope.
- **Singleton:** A single instance of the service is created for the lifetime of the application.

##### **How do you implement API rate limiting?**

API rate limiting in ASP.NET Core Web API can be implemented using middleware or third-party libraries such as AspNetCoreRateLimit. Developers can configure rate-limiting policies based on IP address, client ID, or request path, specifying limits for the number of requests per time interval. The middleware intercepts requests and enforces rate limits, returning appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) when the limit is exceeded.

##### **What are the best practices for API design in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Some best practices for API design in ASP.NET Core Web API include:

Routes can include placeholders for route parameters, allowing dynamic routing based on the values passed in the URL.

##### **How do you return data from a Web API action?**

Data can be returned from a Web API action method using the ActionResult or specific result types such as OkObjectResult, NotFoundResult, BadRequestResult, etc. These result types allow different HTTP status codes and data to be returned. Additionally, data can be returned directly from action methods as objects, which are automatically serialized to JSON or XML based on the client’s request format.

##### **What is JSON and XML serialization in Web API?**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) serialization in Web API refers to the process of converting .NET objects into JSON or XML format for transmission over the network. ASP.NET Core Web API automatically handles the serialization and deserialization of objects based on the content type specified in the request headers. JSON is commonly used for its simplicity and efficiency in data exchange between client and server.

##### **What is dependency injection, and what is its importance in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve loose coupling between components by injecting dependencies into a class rather than creating them internally. In ASP.NET Core Web API, DI is built into the framework and is used to inject services such as repositories, logging, configuration, etc., into controller classes and other components. DI promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability of code.

##### **Explain the concept of Middleware in the ASP.NET Core Web API request pipeline.**

Middleware in ASP.NET Core Web API is software components that are added to the HTTP request pipeline to handle requests and responses. Middleware components can intercept requests and responses, perform operations such as logging, authentication, authorization, exception handling, etc., and pass control to the next middleware in the pipeline. Middleware allows developers to modularize and reuse components in the request processing pipeline.

##### **How do you enable CORS in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in ASP.NET Core Web API can be enabled by configuring CORS policies in the ConfigureServices method of the Startup class using the AddCors method.
