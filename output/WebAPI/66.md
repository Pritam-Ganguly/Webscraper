Back to: [ASP.NET Core Web API Tutorials](https://dotnettutorials.net/course/asp-net-core-web-api-tutorials/)

## **How to Implement Logging using nLog in ASP.NET Core Web API**

In this article, I will discuss How to Implement **Logging using nLog in the ASP.NET Core Web API** Application with Examples. Please read our previous article discussing [**Logging into a SQL Server Database with Serilog in ASP.NET Core Web API**](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/logging-to-database-using-serilog-in-asp-net-core-web-api/) Application.

##### **What is NLog?**

NLog is a free, open-source, and high-performance logging library for various .NET platforms like .NET Core, .NET Framework, Mono, and Xamarin that provides a flexible and powerful way to log application events to different targets, such as files, databases, or even the console. It also has powerful logging capabilities, including structured and asynchronous logging. Integrating NLog into an ASP.NET Core application can help debug, monitor errors, and track performance.

##### **How do you Configure nLog in an ASP.NET Core Web API?**

Let us proceed to understand the step-by-step process of installing and configuring NLog and using NLog to log different types of messages to different targets, such as the Console, Files, and Database, in an ASP.NET Core Web API Application.

##### **Install NLog Package**

To use NLog in ASP.NET Core applications, we need to add **NLog.Web.AspNetCore** packages. This package provides support for integrating NLog with ASP.NET Core. You can install this package using the Package Manager Console by executing the following command:

- **Install-Package NLog.Web.AspNetCore**

##### **Configure NLog**

After installing the required package, we need to configure NLog by adding a nlog.config file to the project root directory. To do so, add an XML file using the Add-> New Item window and give the file name as NLog.config, which should create the file at the project root directory, as shown in the image below.

![Logging using nLog in ASP.NET Core Web API](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22275%22%20height=%22310%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Logging using nLog in ASP.NET Core Web API")

This **NLog.config** XML file defines how logging should be handled (e.g., Log Levels (Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Fatal), Targets (Console, File, Database, etc.), and Rules (Ignoring the System, Microsoft Namespaces logs)). Once you have the NLog.config file, copy and paste the following code.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>

<!--autoReload="true": Automatically reload the config file if it changes while the application is running-->
<!--internalLogLevel="Warn": Set internal logging level for NLog. "Warn" will log only warnings and errors related to NLog itself-->
<!--internalLogFile="internal-nlog.txt": Log internal NLog issues to this file, useful for debugging NLog issues-->
<!--throwConfigExceptions="true": If true, exceptions in the NLog configuration will be thrown, making it easier to debug config issues-->
<nlog xmlns="http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      autoReload="true"
      internalLogLevel="Warn"
      internalLogFile="internal-nlog.txt"
      throwConfigExceptions="true">

 <!-- Define various log targets where logs will be written -->
 <targets>
  <!-- File target: Write logs to a file named "logfile.log" inside the "logs" directory -->
  <!-- name="file": Name for this target, used to refer to it in rules -->
  <!-- fileName="D:/Logs/nlog-all-${shortdate}.log": Path to the file where logs will be saved -->
  <!-- layout: Log format with date, level, logger, message, and exception details if any -->
  <target xsi:type="File"
    name="file"
    fileName="D:/Logs/nlog-all-${shortdate}.log"
    layout="${longdate}|${level:uppercase=true}|${logger}|${message} ${exception:format=ToString}" />

  <!-- Console target: Display logs in the console window -->
  <!-- name="console": Name for this target, used to refer to it in rules -->
  <!-- layout: Format similar to file target -->
  <target xsi:type="Console"
    name="console"
    layout="${longdate}|${level:uppercase=true}|${logger}|${message} ${exception:format=ToString}" />

  <!-- Null target: Discard logs, used to filter out logs from specific namespaces -->
  <!-- name="blackhole": Any logs sent to this target will be ignored or discarded -->
  <target xsi:type="Null" name="blackhole" />
 </targets>

 <!-- Define logging rules to control which logs go to which targets -->
 <!-- Define logging rules for each targets -->
 <rules>
  <!-- Filter out logs from the "Microsoft" namespace by sending them to the "blackhole" target -->
  <!-- minlevel="Trace": Minimum log level, capturing all logs from Trace level upwards -->
  <!-- writeTo="blackhole": Send logs to the blackhole target to ignore them -->
  <!-- final="true": Stop further processing of logs that match this rule -->
  <logger name="Microsoft.*"
    minlevel="Information"
    writeTo="blackhole"
    final="true" />

  <!-- Filter out logs from the "System" namespace by sending them to the "blackhole" target -->
  <logger name="System.*"
    minlevel="Trace"
    writeTo="blackhole"
    final="true" />

  <!-- Send all logs with level Information or higher to the file target -->
  <!-- name="*": Apply this rule to all loggers or you can say all namespaces -->
  <!-- minlevel="Information": Minimum log level is Information -->
  <!-- writeTo="file": Send matching logs to the "file" target -->
  <logger name="*"
    minlevel="Information"
    writeTo="file" />

  <!-- Send all logs with level Debug or higher to the console target -->
  <!-- minlevel="Debug": Minimum log level is Debug -->
  <!-- Send matching logs to the "console" target -->
  <logger name="*"
    minlevel="Information"
    writeTo="console" />
 </rules>
</nlog>
```

##### **Modify NLog.config Copy to Output Directory**

Ensure that your NLog.config file is set to be copied to the output directory. You can set this in the file properties within Visual Studio or modify the .csproj file to include:

```
<ItemGroup>
  <None Include="NLog.config">
    <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
  </None>
</ItemGroup>
```

The above code snippet always copies the NLog.config file to the output directory whenever the project is built. This is useful for configuration files like NLog.config, which the NLog logging library uses to configure logging behavior. It is also important for applications that depend on external configuration at runtime.

##### **Configure NLog as the Logging Provider in Your Application**

Please add the following code to the **Program.cs** file to configure NLog as the application’s default logging provider.

```
using NLog.Web;
namespace LoggingDemo
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

            // Add services to the container.
            builder.Services.AddControllers();
            builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
            builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

            // Configure NLog for ASP.NET Core
            // Clears default logging providers.
            builder.Logging.ClearProviders();

            // Use NLog as the logging provider.
            builder.Host.UseNLog(); 

            var app = builder.Build();

            // Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
            if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseSwagger();
                app.UseSwaggerUI();
            }

            app.UseHttpsRedirection();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.MapControllers();

            app.Run();
        }
    }
}
```

###### **builder.Logging.ClearProviders();**

This line clears all the logging providers that are registered by default in the ASP.NET Core application. ASP.NET Core has several logging providers (like console, debug, etc.). Clearing them ensures that only the logging providers explicitly configure (in this case, NLog) will be used. This can help with performance and prevent duplicate logging entries from different providers.

###### **builder.Host.UseNLog();**

This line configures the application to use NLog as its logging framework. After clearing the default providers, NLog is added to the application’s logging system, allowing us to use NLog for all logging purposes within your ASP.NET Core application.

##### **Logging in Application**

Now that NLog is configured, we can inject ILogger<T> into controllers or services and use it for logging. So, modify the Test controller as follows:

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace LoggingDemo.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class TestController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly ILogger<TestController> _logger;

        public TestController(ILogger<TestController> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpGet("all-logs")]
        public IActionResult LogAllLevels()
        {
            _logger.LogTrace("LogTrace: Entering the LogAllLevels endpoint with Trace-level logging.");

            // Simulate a variable and log it at Trace level
            int calculation = 5 * 10;
            _logger.LogTrace("LogTrace: Calculation value is {calculation}", calculation);

            _logger.LogDebug("LogDebug: Initializing debug-level logs for debugging purposes.");

            // Log some debug information
            var debugInfo = new { Action = "LogAllLevels", Status = "Debugging" };
            _logger.LogDebug("LogDebug: Debug information: {@debugInfo}", debugInfo);

            _logger.LogInformation("LogInformation: The LogAllLevels endpoint was reached successfully.");

            // Simulate a condition that might cause an issue
            bool resourceLimitApproaching = true;
            if (resourceLimitApproaching)
            {
                _logger.LogWarning("LogWarning: Resource usage is nearing the limit. Action may be required soon.");
            }

            try
            {
                // Simulate an error scenario
                int x = 0;
                int result = 10 / x;
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                _logger.LogError(ex, "LogError: An error occurred while processing the request.");
            }

            // Log a critical error scenario
            bool criticalFailure = true;
            if (criticalFailure)
            {
                _logger.LogCritical("LogCritical: A critical system failure has been detected. Immediate attention is required.");
            }

            return Ok("All logging levels demonstrated in this endpoint.");
        }
    }
}
```

##### **Run and Test**

Run the application and access the above endpoint. You should see logs appearing in the configured targets, such as the console and log files in the Logs directory. In the Console Window, you will see the following:

![How to Implement Logging using nLog in ASP.NET Core Web API](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221192%22%20height=%22337%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to Implement Logging using nLog in ASP.NET Core Web API")

Now, verify the Logs folder, and with the nlog-all-current date text file should be created, and you should see the following log messages:

![How to Implement Logging using nLog in the ASP.NET Core Web API Application with Examples](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221378%22%20height=%22472%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to Implement Logging using nLog in the ASP.NET Core Web API Application with Examples")

##### **What is structured logging, and how can we implement it with NLog in ASP.NET Core?**

Structured logging is a logging approach that captures logs as structured data (JSON) rather than simply formatting them as strings. So, instead of treating log messages as simple text, structured logging treats them as structured data (e.g., JSON objects), where each piece of information is a key-value pair. 

Let us see how to log-structured data from the controller and services. Let’s assume we are building an API to manage books in a library. First, define a Book model. Add a folder named **Models** and then a class file named **Book.cs** within the Models folder. Copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace LoggingDemo.Models
{
    public class Book
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Author { get; set; }
        public int YearPublished { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Next, create an API Empty Controller named BooksController within the Controllers folder and then copy and paste the following code, which adds actions to add and retrieve books. Here, we will log-structured data about the operations being performed:

```
using LoggingDemo.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace LoggingDemo.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class BooksController : ControllerBase
    {
        private static readonly List<Book> Books = new List<Book>()
        {
            new Book(){Id = 1001, Title = "ASP.NET Core", Author = "Pranaya", YearPublished = 2019},
            new Book(){Id = 1001, Title = "SQL Server", Author = "Pranaya", YearPublished = 2022}
        };
        private readonly ILogger<BooksController> _logger;

        public BooksController(ILogger<BooksController> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult AddBook([FromBody] Book book)
        {
            Books.Add(book);

            //Structured Logging, i.e., JSON Format
            _logger.LogInformation("Added a new book {@Book}", book);
            return Ok();
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public IActionResult GetBooks()
        {
            //Structured Logging, i.e., JSON Format
            _logger.LogInformation("Retrieved all books. Books: {@Books}", Books);
            return Ok(Books);
        }
    }
}
```

In the above controller, the AddBook action logs the entire book object as structured data using the @ operator, which tells NLog to treat the book object as structured data rather than converting it to a string. The GetBooks action logs all the books as structured data using the @ operator.

##### **Testing and Observing Structured Logs**

Run your application and use a tool like Swagger, Postman or Fiddler to test the API endpoints. For example, to add a new book, you could POST to https://localhost:7234/api/books with a JSON body:

```
{
    "id": 1003,
    "title": "C#.NET",
    "author": "Pranaya",
    "yearPublished": 2023
}
```

Once you access the API with the above request body, you can verify the Console window, and it should display the following message:

![What is structured logging, and how can we implement it with NLog in ASP.NET Core?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221043%22%20height=%2256%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "What is structured logging, and how can we implement it with NLog in ASP.NET Core?")

Now, if you open the txt file, then you will also see the same log as shown in the below image:

![What is structured logging, and how can we implement it with NLog in ASP.NET Core?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221382%22%20height=%22203%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "What is structured logging, and how can we implement it with NLog in ASP.NET Core?")

Similarly, you can also check the other GET Endpoint and observe the logs.

##### **NLOG with Asynchronous Logging in ASP.NET Core Web API**

Asynchronous logging improves application performance by offloading log-writing tasks from the main application thread. This can be helpful for applications that generate a high volume of log messages, as it prevents logging from slowing down the application’s main processes.

To enable asynchronous logging in NLog, we need to configure it to use the AsyncWrapper target. This wrapper will buffer log events and write them asynchronously to improve performance by reducing the time spent logging in the main application thread.

We need to wrap File Target with AsyncWrapper. By wrapping the File target in an AsyncWrapper, we enable asynchronous logging to that file target. To enable asynchronous logging with NLog, please modify the nlog.config file as follows.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<nlog xmlns="http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      autoReload="true" 
      internalLogLevel="Warn"
      internalLogFile="internal-nlog.txt"
   throwConfigExceptions="true">

 <!-- Define various log targets where logs will be written -->
 <targets>

  <!-- AsyncWrapper target for asynchronous File logging -->
  <target xsi:type="AsyncWrapper"
                name="asyncFileWrapper">
   
   <!-- File target inside AsyncWrapper -->
   <target xsi:type="File"
    name="file"
    fileName="D:/Logs/nlog-all-${shortdate}.log"
    layout="${longdate}|${level:uppercase=true}|${logger}|${message} ${exception:format=ToString}" />
  </target>

  <!-- Console target: Display logs in the console window (without async wrapper, as console writes are usually fast) -->
  <target xsi:type="Console"
    name="console"
    layout="${longdate}|${level:uppercase=true}|${logger}|${message} ${exception:format=ToString}" />

  <!-- Null target: Discard logs, used to filter out logs from specific namespaces -->
  <target xsi:type="Null" name="blackhole" />
 </targets>

 <!-- Define logging rules to control which logs go to which targets -->
 <rules>
  <!-- Filter out logs from the "Microsoft" namespace by sending them to the "blackhole" target -->
  <logger name="Microsoft.*" 
    minlevel="Trace" 
    writeTo="blackhole" 
    final="true" />

  <!-- Filter out logs from the "System" namespace by sending them to the "blackhole" target -->
  <logger name="System.*" 
    minlevel="Trace" 
    writeTo="blackhole" 
    final="true" />

  <!-- Send all logs with level Information or higher to the file target -->
  <logger name="*" 
    minlevel="Information" 
    writeTo="file" />

  <!-- Send all logs with level Debug or higher to the console target -->
  <logger name="*" 
    minlevel="Debug" 
    writeTo="console" />
 </rules>
</nlog>
```

##### **How Do We Remove the Older Text files using NLog in ASP.NET Core Web API?**

To automatically delete older log files in NLog, we need to configure the File target with the archiveEvery, archiveFileName, archiveNumbering, and maxArchiveFiles options. NLog does not support directly removing files older than a certain date (e.g., 7 days), but we can achieve a similar effect by archiving log files daily and keeping only a specific number of archived files (e.g., seven files, equivalent to the last 7 days if archived daily). For a better understanding, please modify the Nlog.config file as follows:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<nlog xmlns="http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      autoReload="true"
      internalLogLevel="Warn"
      internalLogFile="internal-nlog.txt"
   throwConfigExceptions="true">

 <!-- Define various log targets where logs will be written -->
 <targets>

  <!-- AsyncWrapper target for asynchronous File logging -->
  <target xsi:type="AsyncWrapper"
                name="asyncFileWrapper">

   <!-- File target inside AsyncWrapper -->
   <!--filename: Current log file path-->
   <!--archiveFileName: Archived log file path with incremented numbering-->
   <!--archiveEvery: Archive log file at the end of every day-->
   <!--archiveNumbering: Number archived files sequentially-->
   <!--maxArchiveFiles: Keep only the last 7 archived log files-->
   <target xsi:type="File"
    name="file"
    fileName="D:/Logs/nlog-all-${shortdate}.log"
    archiveFileName="D:/Logs/archived/log_{#}.log" 
    archiveEvery="Day"
    archiveNumbering="Rolling"
    maxArchiveFiles="7"
    layout="${longdate}|${level:uppercase=true}|${logger}|${message} ${exception:format=ToString}" />
  </target>

  <!-- Console target: Display logs in the console window (without async wrapper, as console writes are usually fast) -->
  <target xsi:type="Console"
    name="console"
    layout="${longdate}|${level:uppercase=true}|${logger}|${message} ${exception:format=ToString}" />

  <!-- Null target: Discard logs, used to filter out logs from specific namespaces -->
  <target xsi:type="Null" name="blackhole" />
 </targets>

 <!-- Define logging rules to control which logs go to which targets -->
 <rules>
  <!-- Filter out logs from the "Microsoft" namespace by sending them to the "blackhole" target -->
  <logger name="Microsoft.*"
    minlevel="Trace"
    writeTo="blackhole"
    final="true" />

  <!-- Filter out logs from the "System" namespace by sending them to the "blackhole" target -->
  <logger name="System.*"
    minlevel="Trace"
    writeTo="blackhole"
    final="true" />

  <!-- Send all logs with level Information or higher to the file target -->
  <logger name="*"
    minlevel="Information"
    writeTo="file" />

  <!-- Send all logs with level Debug or higher to the console target -->
  <logger name="*"
    minlevel="Debug"
    writeTo="console" />
 </rules>
</nlog>
```

##### **Explanation of Settings for Archiving and Retention**

- **archiveEvery=”Day”:** This setting archives the log file at the end of each day.
- **archiveFileName=”D:/Logs/archived/log\_{#}.log”:** Defines the name and location for archived files. {#} is a placeholder for a sequential number that NLog increments with each new archive file.
- **archiveNumbering=”Rolling”:** This numbering strategy maintains sequential numbering for each archived file.
- **maxArchiveFiles=”7″:** Limits the number of archived files to 7. When a new day’s log file is created and archived, NLog will delete the oldest file if there are already seven archived files, effectively keeping logs for only the last 7 days.
