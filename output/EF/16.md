## **Key Attribute in Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**

In this article, I will discuss **Key Data Annotation Attributes in Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** with Examples. Please read our previous article, discussing the **[Column Data Annotation Attribute in Entity Framework Core](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/column-attribute-in-entity-framework-core/)** with Examples.

##### **What is the Primary Key in the Database?**

A Primary Key is a constraint in a relational database that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It combines the characteristics of both UNIQUE and NOT NULL constraints. This ensures:

- **Uniqueness:** No two rows can have the same values in the primary key columns.
- **Not Null:** Primary key columns cannot contain NULL values.

The primary key plays an important role in enforcing entity integrity by uniquely identifying each record in a table. A table can have only one primary key, which may consist of a single column or multiple columns (referred to as a composite primary key).

##### **Key Attribute in Entity Framework Core**

In Entity Framework Core (EF Core), the Key Attribute is a data annotation used to explicitly mark a property as the primary key of a corresponding database table. By default, EF Core tries to infer the primary key based on naming conventions, but the Key Attribute allows us to override this default behavior.

##### **Default Primary Key Convention**

By default, EF Core assumes that any property named Id or <EntityName>Id (case-insensitive) is the primary key. For example, for an entity named Student, EF Core will automatically treat properties like StudentId, studentid, or ID as the primary key.

For example, let us modify the **Student.cs** entity as follows. In the below example, EF Core automatically treats StudentId as the primary key because of its naming convention. So, this property will be created as a Primary Key column in the corresponding database table.

```
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int StudentId { get; set; }
        public string? FirstName { get; set; }
        public string? LastName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Modifying DbContext**

Next, modify the DbContext class, i.e., the EFCoreDbContext class, as follows. Here, we are adding the Student entity as a DbSet Property and providing the property name as Students so that the database will create a table with the name Students.

```
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class EFCoreDbContext : DbContext
    {
        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(@"Server=LAPTOP-6P5NK25R\SQLSERVER2022DEV;Database=EFCoreDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;");
        }

        public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
    }
}
```

As we already discussed, whenever we add or update domain classes or configurations, we need to sync the database with the model using **Add-Migration** and **Update-Database** commands. So, open the Package Manager Console and Execute the **add-migration** and **update-database** commands as follows.

![Key Attribute in Entity Framework Core](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221277%22%20height=%22413%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Key Attribute in Entity Framework Core")

If you verify the database, you should see the following table. As you can see, the StudentId column is created as the primary key column.

##### **Changing the Primary Key Property**

If our business requirement is not to use StudentId as the primary key, we can define another property as the primary key using the Key Attribute. We want to create **StudentRegdNo** as the primary key column in our database for the Students table. Then, this default convention of EF Core will not work. Let us prove this. Let us modify the Student entity class as follows. Here, instead of StudentId, we are using the StudentRegdNo property.

```
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int StudentRegdNo { get; set; }
        public string? FirstName { get; set; }
        public string? LastName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

With the above changes, open the Package Manager Console and Execute the **add-migration** command.

![Changing the Primary Key Property](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221323%22%20height=%22353%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Changing the Primary Key Property")

As you can see in the above image, executing the **add-migration** command throws an exception saying the entity type ‘Student’ requires a primary key to be defined. If you intended to use a keyless entity type, call **‘HasNoKey’** in **‘OnModelCreating’**.

##### **How to Overcome the Above Error?**

To overcome the above error, we need to mark the **StudentRegdNo** property as the key property so that EF Core will make this property the Primary Key column in the corresponding database table. For this, we need to use the **Key Attribute** in EF Core. If you go to the definition of the Key Attribute, you will see the following: It is a sealed class with a parameter-less constructor.

![Key Attribute in Entity Framework Core](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22702%22%20height=%22233%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Key Attribute in Entity Framework Core")

So, to override the default behavior and specify a different property as the primary key, we need to use the Key Attribute. For example, if we want StudentRegdNo to be the primary, we need to explicitly decorate the **StudentRegdNo** property with **[Key]** as follows. The key Attribute will mark **the StudentRegdNo** property as the key property, and the entity framework core will generate the Primary key for the **StudentRegdNo** property in the database.

```
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Student
    {
        [Key]
        public int StudentRegdNo { get; set; }
        public string? FirstName { get; set; }
        public string? LastName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

After making the above changes, open the Package Manager Console and Execute the following **Add-Migration** and **Update-Database** commands.

![How to Overcome the Above Error?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22858%22%20height=%22342%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to Overcome the Above Error?")

Now, verify the database. You should see **StudentRegdNo** as the primary key, as shown in the image below.

![What is the Key Attribute in Entity Framework Core?](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22372%22%20height=%22311%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "What is the Key Attribute in Entity Framework Core?")

##### **How to Make Composite Primary Key in Entity Framework Core:**

In EF Core, we cannot use the Key attribute to define a composite primary key. Instead, composite keys must be defined using the **Fluent API** or the **PrimaryKey Attribute** (introduced in EF Core 7.0). If you go to the definition of **PrimaryKey Attribute,** you will see the following: It is a sealed class with one constructor and one property.

![How to Make Composite Primary Key in Entity Framework Core](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%221175%22%20height=%22241%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to Make Composite Primary Key in Entity Framework Core")

##### **PropertyNames:**

This property holds the list of property names that constitute the primary key for the entity. The **IReadOnlyList<string>** type ensures that this list is immutable (i.e., it cannot be modified after being set). The list contains the names of the properties in the order in which they are part of the primary key.

##### **Constructor**

The constructor takes one required parameter propertyName and additional parameters additionalPropertyNames (using params for flexibility). This allows us to specify a single or composite primary key when applying this attribute.

- **propertyName:** The name of the first property in the primary key.
- **additionalPropertyNames:** Any additional properties that are part of the composite key (if the primary key consists of more than one property).

The constructor initializes the PropertyNames list with the provided propertyName and adds any additional property names to the list.

##### **Important Notes:**

- You cannot apply this PrimaryKey Attribute on an already created database table, and if you try, you will get the error: **System.InvalidOperationException: To change the IDENTITY property of a column, the column needs to be dropped and recreated.**
- The Composite primary keys are configured by placing the [PrimaryKey] attribute on the entity type, not at the property level.

##### **Example to Create Composite Primary Key using EF Core:**

So, let us first delete the EFCoreDB database from the SQL Server using SSMS and then delete the Migration folder from our project.

Next, modify the Student Entity Class as follows. As you can see, we have applied the **PrimaryKey** Attribute to the **Student** Entity and passed the **RegdNo** and **SerialNo** properties. This creates a composite key based on RegdNo and SerialNo. EF Core will generate a composite primary key in the database, but neither property will be marked as an identity column.

```
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    [PrimaryKey(nameof(RegdNo), nameof(SerialNo))]
    public class Student
    {
        public int RegdNo { get; set; }
        public int SerialNo { get; set; }
        public string? FirstName { get; set; }
        public string? LastName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

After making the above changes, open the Package Manager Console and Execute the add-migration and update-database commands as follows.

**![Example to Create Composite Primary Key using EF Core](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22862%22%20height=%22343%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Example to Create Composite Primary Key using EF Core")**

Now, verify the database. As shown in the image below, you should see a composite primary key based on two columns.

![Example to Create Composite Primary Key using EF Core](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22375%22%20height=%22330%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Example to Create Composite Primary Key using EF Core")

##### **Primary Key on Non-Integer Properties using Entity Framework Core**

EF Core allows the creation of a primary key on non-integer properties, including strings. However, when we define a primary key on a string, it will not be created as an identity column. For a better understanding, please modify the Student entity as follows. As you can see, we have created the StudentId property with the string data type, and the EF core will mark this property as the primary key in the database. But this will not be marked as an Identity column.

```
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Student
    {
        public string StudentId { get; set; }
        public string SerialNo { get; set; }
        public string? FirstName { get; set; }
        public string? LastName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

We can also create a composite Primary Key using string properties. For a better understanding, modify the Student entity as follows. As you can see, we have marked the RegdNo and SerialNo properties as String type, and then we create a composite primary key based on these two properties, and it will work.

```
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    [PrimaryKey(nameof(RegdNo), nameof(SerialNo))]
    public class Student
    {
        public string RegdNo { get; set; }
        public string SerialNo { get; set; }
        public string? FirstName { get; set; }
        public string? LastName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **GUID as Primary Key**

If you want to use a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) as a primary key, EF Core also allows this. GUIDs are often used for distributed systems where unique identifiers need to be generated across different servers without collisions. For a better understanding, modify the Student entity as follows:

```
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Student
    {
        [Key]
        public Guid StudentId { get; set; }
        public string? FirstName { get; set; }
        public string? LastName { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Points to Remember**

- **Identity Columns:** Identity columns are created by default for integer-based primary keys. This behavior is disabled for composite keys or non-integer types.
- **Composite Primary Key:** To create a composite primary key, use the Fluent API or the [PrimaryKey] attribute introduced in EF Core 7.0.
- **PrimaryKey Attribute:** The [PrimaryKey] attribute is applied at the entity type level and is useful for defining both single and composite primary keys.
- **Non-Integer Primary Keys:** EF Core allows non-integer properties as primary keys, but they won’t be identity columns.
