## **How to Design Database using EF Core Code First Approach:**

In this article, I will discuss **How to Design a Database using the EF Core Code First** Approach. The Code-First approach in Entity Framework Core (EF Core) allows us to design the database starting from the C# domain classes rather than designing the database first and then generating the models. Once we create the model classes and DbContext class, EF Core will take responsibility for translating these model classes into database tables.

Let us develop a comprehensive Student Management System for an educational institution. We will also use this application as the base for the upcoming articles. We will work with the same application we have been using so far. So, let us proceed to create the Model classes. We will create all the Model classes within the Entities folder.

##### **Student:**

The Student model represents students within the institution, including personal details and academic information. So, create a class file named **Student.cs** within the **Entities** folder and copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Student
    {
        public int StudentId { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
        public string Gender { get; set; }
        public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
        public int BranchId { get; set; }
        public Branch Branch { get; set; }
        public Address Address { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Course> Courses { get; set; }
    }
}
```

###### **Properties Description**:

- **StudentId:** Primary Key. Unique identifier for each student.
- **FirstName:** First name of the student.
- **LastName:** Last name of the student.
- **Gender:** Gender of the student.
- **DateOfBirth:** Date of birth of the student.
- **BranchId:** Foreign Key. Links the student to a specific branch.
- **Branch:** The Branch navigation property represents the branch the student belongs to.
- **Address:** Navigation property for the student’s address.
- **Courses:** A collection representing the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.

###### **Relationships:**

- **Branch:** A Student belongs to one Branch (one-to-one).
- **Courses:** A Student can enroll in many Courses (one-to-many).
- **Address:** A Student has one Address (one-to-one relationship).

##### **Branch:**

This model represents a branch. That means there are multiple branches of the institutions. It will represent a particular branch. So, create a class file named **Branch.cs** within the **Entities** folder and copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Branch
    {
        public int BranchId { get; set; }
        public string BranchLocation { get; set; }
        public string? BranchPhoneNumber { get; set; }
        public string? BranchEmail { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Student> Students { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Teacher> Teachers { get; set; }
    }
}
```

###### **Properties Description**:

- **BranchId:** Primary Key. Unique identifier for each branch.
- **BranchLocation:** Location or Address of the branch.
- **BranchPhoneNumber:** (Optional) Phone number for the branch.
- **BranchEmail:** (Optional) Email address for the branch.
- **Students:** Collection of students enrolled in this branch.
- **Teachers:** A collection of teachers has been assigned to this branch.

###### **Relationships:**

- **Students:** A Branch can have multiple Students (one-to-many).
- **Teachers:** A Branch can have multiple Teachers (one-to-many).

##### **Teacher:**

This model represents teachers in the system. So, create a class file named **Teacher.cs** within the **Entities** folder and copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Teacher
    {
        public int TeacherId { get; set; }
        public string TeacherName { get; set; }
        public int BranchId { get; set; }
        public Branch Branch { get; set; }
        public Address Address { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Subject> Subjects { get; set; }
    }
}
```

###### **Properties Description**:

- **TeacherId:** Primary Key. Unique identifier for each teacher.
- **TeacherName:** Name of the teacher.
- **BranchId:** Foreign Key. Links the teacher to a specific branch.
- **Branch:** The Branch navigation property represents the branch the teacher works for.
- **Address:** Navigation property for the teacher’s address.
- **Subjects:** Collection of subjects taught by the teacher.

###### **Relationships:**

- **Branch:** A Teacher works in one Branch (one-to-one).
- **Subjects:** A Teacher can teach multiple Subjects (one-to-many).
- **Address:** A Teacher has one Address (one-to-one relationship).

##### **Subject:**

This Model contains information about subjects taught in the institution, including their names and descriptions. So, create a class file named **Subject.cs** within the **Entities** folder and copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Subject
    {
        public int SubjectId { get; set; }
        public string SubjectName { get; set; }
        public string Description { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Teacher> Teachers { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Course> Courses { get; set; }
    }
}
```

###### **Properties Description**:

- **SubjectId:** Primary Key. Unique identifier for each subject.
- **SubjectName:** Name of the subject.
- **Description:** Description of the subject.
- **Teachers:** Collection of teachers who teach the subject.
- **Courses:** Collection of courses that include the subject.

###### **Relationships:**

- **Teachers:** A Subject can have multiple Teachers (one-to-many).
- **Courses:** A Subject can be part of multiple Courses (one-to-many).

##### **Address:**

This model represents the addresses of both students and teachers. So, create a class file named **Address.cs** within the **Entities** folder and copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Address
    {
        public int AddressId { get; set; }
        public string Street { get; set; }
        public string City { get; set; }
        public string State { get; set; }
        public string PostalCode { get; set; }
        public int? StudentId { get; set; }
        public Student Student { get; set; }

- **Teacher:** The navigation property is for the teacher at this address.

###### **Relationships:**

- **Student:** An address can be assigned to one Student (one-to-one).
- **Teacher:** An address can be assigned to one Teacher (one-to-one).

##### **Course:**

This model represents courses that students enroll in. So, create a class file named **Course.cs** within the **Entities** folder and copy and paste the following code.

```
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class Course
    {
        public int CourseId { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Description { get; set; }
        public string Fees { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Student> Students { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Subject> Subjects { get; set; }
    }
}
```

###### **Properties Description**:

- **CourseId:** Primary Key. Unique identifier for each course.
- **Name:** Name of the course.
- **Description:** Description of the course.
- **Fees:** Course fees.
- **Students:** Collection of students enrolled in the course.
- **Subjects:** Collection of subjects included in the course.

###### **Relationships:**

- **Students:** A Course can have multiple Students (one-to-many).
- **Subjects:** A Course can have multiple Subjects (one-to-many).

##### **Modifying the Context Class:**

Next, modify the **EFCoreDbContext** class as follows. Now, we will work with the StudentDB. If the StudentDB database exists, it will use it or create a new StudentDB database if it does not exist. Inside this StudentDB database, it will create the Required database tables, which we specified as DbSet<T> entities.

```
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
namespace EFCoreCodeFirstDemo.Entities
{
    public class EFCoreDbContext : DbContext
    {
        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            // Enable Logging
            optionsBuilder.LogTo(Console.WriteLine, LogLevel.Information);

            //Connection String
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=LAPTOP-6P5NK25R\\SQLSERVER2022DEV;Database=StudentDB;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;");
        }

        // DbSet properties represent the tables in the database. 
        // Each DbSet corresponds to a table, and the type parameter corresponds to the entity class mapped to that table.
        public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Teacher> Teachers { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Branch> Branches { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Address> Addresses { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Subject> Subjects { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Course> Courses { get; set; }
    }
}
```

##### **Generating Migration and Syncing with Database**

The most important point is that whenever we add or update domain classes or configurations, we need to sync the database with the model. For every change we make to our Model classes, we must create a Migration File and sync the database using **the Add-Migration** command and **Update-Database** commands using the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio.

To do so, open the NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio by selecting **Tools => NuGet Package Manager => Package Manager Console** from the menu below. Then, execute the **Add-Migration CreatingStudentDatabase** command, as shown in the image below. Please select the Project where you want to generate the Migration.

**![How to Design Database using EF Core Code First Approach](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22855%22%20height=%22198%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to Design Database using EF Core Code First Approach")**

##### **Updating the Database:**

After creating the migration file, we need to update the database using the **Update-Database** command. We can use the **–verbose** option to view the generated SQL statements executed in the target database. So, open the Package Manager Console and execute the **Update-Database -Verbose** command, as shown in the image below.

![How to Design Database using EF Core Code First Approach](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22937%22%20height=%22122%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to Design Database using EF Core Code First Approach")

Once the above command is executed successfully, it will generate and execute the required SQL Statements in the defined database. You can also verify the database and database tables using SSMS, as shown in the image below.

![How to Design Database using EF Core Code First Approach](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22298%22%20height=%22410%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "How to Design Database using EF Core Code First Approach")

As you can see, in addition to the Addresses, Branches, Courses, Students, Subjects, and Teachers database tables that we specified as the DbSet property in our DBContext class, it also created the CourseStudent, CourseSubject, and SubjectTeacher tables.

The extra tables (CourseStudent, CourseSubject, and SubjectTeacher) that were generated during the migration process are junction tables (also called join tables) created by Entity Framework Core (EF Core) to manage the many-to-many relationships between the entities.

##### **Why were these junction tables created?**

Many-to-many relationships between two tables cannot be directly represented in relational databases. Instead, an intermediary table (also known as a junction table) is used to map the relationship. This table contains the foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the related tables. Let’s understand the many-to-many relationships in our models and the corresponding junction tables:

##### **Student ↔ Course (Many-to-Many)**

Our Student class has an ICollection<Course> Courses property, indicating that a student can enroll in multiple courses. Similarly, our Course class has an ICollection<Student> Students property, indicating that a course can have multiple students.

Since EF Core needs to model this many-to-many relationship, it creates a junction table named **CourseStudent** (EF Core uses the names of both entities to name the junction table). This table stores:

- A foreign key to the Student (e.g., StudentsStudentId). It is created as the database name plus the primary key column name.
- A foreign key to the Course (e.g., CoursesCourseId). It is created as the database name plus the primary key column name.

This allows multiple students to enroll in multiple courses. If you verify the database, you will see the following structure of the CourseStudent table. It also creates the primary key as a composite primary key.

![Student ↔ Course (Many-to-Many)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22362%22%20height=%22112%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Student ↔ Course (Many-to-Many)")

##### **Course ↔ Subject (Many-to-Many)**

Our Course class has an ICollection<Subject> Subjects property, meaning a course can include multiple subjects. Similarly, our Subject class has an ICollection<Course> Courses property, meaning a subject can be part of multiple courses. So, to represent this many-to-many relationship, EF Core generates a junction table named CourseSubject, which contains:

- A foreign key to the Course (e.g., CoursesCourseId). It is pointing to the CourseId column of the Courses table.
- A foreign key to the Subject (e.g., SubjectsSubjectId). It is pointing to the SubjectId column of the Subjects table.

If you verify the database, you will see the following structure for the CourseSubject database table. It also creates the primary key as a composite primary key.

![Course ↔ Subject (Many-to-Many)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22363%22%20height=%22117%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Course ↔ Subject (Many-to-Many)")

##### **Teacher ↔ Subject (Many-to-Many)**

Our Teacher class has an ICollection<Subject> Subjects property, indicating that a teacher can teach multiple subjects. Similarly, in our Subject class, there’s an ICollection<Teacher> Teachers property, indicating that multiple teachers can teach a subject. EF Core automatically creates a junction table named SubjectTeacher to represent this many-to-many relationship, storing:

- A foreign key to Teacher (e.g., TeachersTeacherId).
- A foreign key to Subject (e.g., SubjectsSubjectId).

If you verify the database, you will see the following structure for the SubjectTeacher table. It also creates the primary key as a composite primary key.

![Teacher ↔ Subject (Many-to-Many)](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20width=%22358%22%20height=%22108%22%3E%3C/svg%3E "Teacher ↔ Subject (Many-to-Many)")

**Note:** In EF Core 5.0 and above, the framework automatically supports many-to-many relationships, so we don’t need to define a separate entity for the junction table explicitly. EF Core automatically creates the junction tables to represent these relationships.

##### **Adding Data for Testing Purposes:**

In our upcoming articles, I will show you how to develop this application using ASP.NET Core MVC. But now, our intention is to understand the EF Core concepts like Lazy Loading, Eager Loading, Explicit Loading, Asynchronous Operations, Transaction Management, and Fluent API Configurations.

Let’s first understand these concepts using these Models and the DbContext class. Once we understand the EF Core concepts, we will develop the complete application. To understand these concepts, we need some data. So, please execute the following SQL Statements in the StudentDB database we created using EF Core Migration to populate the database tables with data.
